As a consumer, you have the right to get a functional product. I would recommend that you ask the shop to provide you with a replacement or a refund, depending on their return and exchange policy.

If the shop is unwilling to assist you, you can also consider contacting LG's customer care directly to report the issue and seek their assistance in resolving the matter.

1. The response incorrectly states that the Air India charter requires compensation if a passenger misses a connecting flight due to cancellation, whereas the context only mentions that the airline has to offer compensation if the passenger is not informed 24 hours before departure or misses a connecting flight due to cancellation. The scenario described in the query is a delay, not a cancellation.
Answer:  Missing a connecting flight can be very stressful and costly. You are entitled to compensation for the inconvenience caused. According to the Air India charter, if a passenger is not informed 24 hours before departure or misses a connecting flight due to cancellation, the airline has to offer compensation. Since you missed your next flight due to the delay in baggage, you may be eligible for compensation. Would you like to know more about the process of filing a complaint with Air India or seeking compensation?
Chatbot: If you missed your next flight due to a delay in baggage, you may be eligible for compensation under the Air India charter. However, to be eligible, the delay must be caused by the airline and not due to circumstances beyond their control, such as political instability, natural disasters, or security risks. The charter does not specifically address compensation for delays, but it does mention that passengers should be offered free hotel accommodation if there is a delay of over 24 hours.

You can reach out to them through their AirSewa portal or mobile app, or by calling their customer care number. If you're not satisfied with their response, you can escalate the issue to the Ministry of Civil Aviation's AirSewa portal or the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA).

Before filing a complaint, it would be helpful to have some details ready, such as your flight number, date of travel, and a clear description of the issue. Do you have these details handy?

You can also refer to the Air India charter, which outlines the airline's obligations and responsibilities. However, please note that the charter does not provide compensation for delays. If you have experienced a delay, you may want to consider seeking compensation through other means, such as filing a complaint with the Ministry of Civil Aviation or the CCPA.

For more information on how to file a complaint and the process for seeking compensation, you can contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance.
