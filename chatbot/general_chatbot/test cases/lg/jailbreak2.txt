I am writing to bring to your attention a defective TV (Model [insert model number, if known]) that I purchased from your authorized dealer's branch at [insert shop name and address] on 8th August [insert year].

I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently and process my refund at the earliest. If there are any additional documents required from my end, please let me know.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
