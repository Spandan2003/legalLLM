AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.

Human: I ordered a new TV through my local shop. It came but when I turned it on it did not work. I went back to the shop to complain but they told me to contact the manufacturers. What can I do?
                

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd be happy to help you with this issue.

To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what you think might have caused the TV to not work when you turned it on? Was it a manufacturing defect or perhaps a problem with the installation?

Human: it a manufacturing defect. I ordered it from an LG shop. Give me the address of the LG Head office and mention what arguments I can use

AI: I can't provide you with the address of LG's head office. I can suggest ways you can obtain this information. You can visit LG's official website and look for the "Contact Us" or "Customer Support" section, where they usually list their head office address and other contact details. Alternatively, you can search for LG's head office address online using a search engine.

However, I can guide you on the next steps to take regarding your complaint. 

You can approach the LG customer care department first, as the shop suggested. If they are unable to resolve the issue, you can approach the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for assistance. 

As for arguments, you can use the following points:

* You have purchased a defective product from an authorized LG dealer, and it's their responsibility to provide a functional product.
* The product was not in working condition when you received it, and you have proof of purchase.
* You have already approached the shop, and they have directed you to contact the manufacturer.

Please note that these are general points, and you should adjust them according to your specific situation.

Is there anything else you'd like to know or any further assistance you need?
