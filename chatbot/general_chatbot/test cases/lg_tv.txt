I ordered a new TV through my local shop. It came but when I turned it on it did not work. I went back to the shop to complain but they told me to contact the manufacturers. What can I do?
They told me that manufacturer will do whatever is needed. It is not their resposibility. The TV was from LG. Can you give me its customer care number and its office address?
