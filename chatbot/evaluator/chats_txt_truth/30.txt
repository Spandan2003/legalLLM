Human: Hello Consumer Grievance Assistance Chatbot. I purchased some silver jewellery from a shop recently but I faced some issues regarding deduction of weight and purity of the products. I want to file a consumer complaint in the consumer court but need help understanding the process.

Bot: Sure, I would be happy to guide you through the entire process. But first, let me understand the full details of what happened. When did you make this jewellery purchase and give a description of the purchase?

Human: I purchased 2 pairs of silver leg chains and 2 pairs of silver metti tags on 1st January 2022 from Lalitha Jewellery Mart in Madurai. The total bill amount was Rs. 11,013.

Bot: Okay. And from the options, I show below, what best describes how you made the payment for this purchase?  1. Full payment in cash 2. Part cash, part old jewellery exchange 3. Full old jewellery exchange

Human: I did part payment in cash and part by exchange of my old silver chain.

Bot: Understood. Could you please confirm your name, age and full residential address? This is required from a jurisdiction perspective when filing the case.

Human: My name is V. Ramaraj, age 48 years, residing at Pasumpon Nagar, Madurai.

Bot: Thanks for confirming. So you exchanged an old silver chain while purchasing the new jewellery on 1st Jan 2022. What was the net weight of this old chain?

Human: The old silver chain weighed approximately 201 grams which I had purchased from the same Lalitha Jewellery shop about 1 year back.

Bot: Okay. And what was the issue you faced during this exchange? Please explain the problem in detail.

Human: As per standard market practice, while exchanging old silver items, shops deduct some weight for wastage and pay as per latest market rate for remaining net weight. In my case, when valuing the 201 grams old silver chain for exchange, the shop should have deducted 4 grams for dust wastage which is reasonable. But apart from 4 grams they also deducted 59 grams over and above this claiming it as processing wastage charges. So they calculated the exchange value only for the remaining 138 grams instead of at least 197 grams (201 grams - 4 grams dust charges). This 59 grams deduction was very unreasonable and resulted in financial loss to me.

Bot: According to you this 59 grams deduction is beyond normal standards and unacceptable?

Human: Yes, absolutely! As a consumer, I felt cheated. The silver jewellery that is 201 grams was brought from the same shop and I paid for the full 201 grams so when I exchanged it I should have got an appropriate return on the exchanged silver.

Bot: Noted. Usually 5-10% is the max wastage deduction, not 30%. I should have got a value of at least 197 grams after allowing 4 grams for dust. We have the option to send a legal notice and file a consumer complaint.

Human: I also have another issue related to the same transaction.

Bot: Please elaborate in detail.

Human: Yes, another problem I faced was that the 190 grams new silver leg chain I purchased as part of this purchase broke in just a few days! It looks like the new silver chain given to me was made of impure silver.

Bot: I understand. We can send the legal notice or file a complaint for both the issues as they are part of the same transaction.

Human: kindly draft legal notice and the complaint.

Bot: Can you please confirm your occupation and address

Human: V.Ramaraj, S/o. Varadarajulu, Age-45, Occupation: Sub-inspector, r/o Pasumpon Nagar, Madurai.

Bot: Can you please confirm the opposite party's address.

Human: Lalitha Jewellery Mart Private Limited, No.180-182,South Masi Street, Madurai - 1

Bot: As both the parties reside in Madurai, the district consumer redressal commission Madurai will have the jurisdiction to try the case. What remedy would you like to seek from the court, like replacement of impure silver or compensation or both?

Human: I want compensation for the 59 grams of silver, for which the payment was not made. Further I want compensation of 5 lakh for causing stress and mental agony.

Bot: Thankyou. Kindly share the document that could be helpful to draft the complaint and notice.

Human: I have uploaded the receipts of transactions.

Bot: Thank you. On the basis of the documents that you have given me, I have drafted a pre-filled Notice. and a Complaint.. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same? BEFORE THE HON’BLE DISTRICT CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL COMMISSION AT MADURAI CONSUMER COMPLAINT NO. ______of 2023 IN THE MATTER OF: V.Ramaraj, S/o.

Herein the above-named Complainant most respectfully submits as under,  That the complainant wanted to buy the silver ornaments. So he went to a Jewellery shop named Lalitha Jewellery Mart Private Limited. Which was run by the opposite party. On 01.01.2016, the complainant  purchased 2 pairs of silver leg chains and 2 pairs of metti tags, totaling 305.830 grams, from the Opposite Party. The complainant paid rupees 11,013.42 for the purchased  Jewellery according to the per gram rate in the market. The opposite party issued the bill no 33783/15-16 for said transaction. It is submitted that as the complainant didn’t have enough money at the time of purchasing the silver, the complainant exchanged his old silver chain weighing 201 grams which was purchased from the same shop of the opposite party a year ago. The complainant expected that the opposite party would calculate the price of the old silver weighing 201 grams after deducting the dust cost at a per gram rate and deduct that price from the new silver purchased.  Hence the complainant would pay less for the new silver purchased.practice. But to the surprise of the complainant the opposite party unfairly deducted 59 grams from the gross weight of 201 grams of my old chain, apart from 4 grams for dust wastage. They calculated the amount only for the remaining 138 grams instead of 201 grams. This is a clear case of unfair trade. It is submitted that at the time of purchasing the exchanged ornament earlier, the complainant had paid separately for each milligram of silver. Therefore, while evaluating the exchanged silver ornament, the Opposite Party was only permitted to deduct weight for dust wastage and pay as per market rate for the remaining silver. Complainant after exchanging the old ornament paid balance of Rs.6,128/- for the entire value of Rs.11013.62/- on 1/1/2016 It is further submitted that the new 190 gram silver leg chain purchased on 01.01.2016 has impure silver and due to this the chain broke within a few days of purchase. This amounts to deficiency in service as the Opposite Party sold defective products made of spurious silver. This conduct of the opposite party by deducting the weight of the old ornament made the complainant pay more price for the new silver and caused financial loss to the complainant. Further the new silver leg chain broke in a few days and hence caused mental agony to the complainant. Hence, the complainant has approached the hon’ble forum. CAUSE OF ACTION: The cause of action arose on 01.01.2016 when the complainant exchanged an old silver chain weighing 201 grams for new silver ornaments. However, the opposite party unfairly deducted 59 grams from the gross weight, in addition to 4 grams for dust wastage.
