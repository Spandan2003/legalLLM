Human: The yield of the crop was much lower than the promised quantity for the seed variety purchased. What do I do now?

Bot: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you provide me with further details about your issue?

Human: I purchased the new AX213 variety of chilli seeds from ABC Agro Private Limited on 12/04/2022, and used them in my four-acre plot of land. I was told that the yield would be around 15 quintals, but I got only 8 quintals (Harvest time period: 12/08/2022 – 30/08/2022)

Bot: How many packets of seeds did you purchase, what was the weight of each of the packets and the price of the packet?

Human: I bought 10 packets of chilli seeds each weighing 250 grams, and the cost price of each of the packets was Rs 3500/-

Bot: Okay. Did you follow the instructions pertaining to the use of the seeds?

Human: Yes, I did.

Bot: Did the terms and conditions have any disclaimer as to the final yield?

Human: No, there was no mention of anything regarding that. It was an oral promise given by the seller with respect to the yield.

Bot: Okay. I understand. Please make sure you have something in writing which describes the promise given to you regarding the final harvest.

Human: Okay.

Bot: Did you approach the opposite party for compensation?

Human: Yes, I first approached them on 10/06/2022 with respect to compensation for the loss incurred in respect of the final output I also sent reminder emails on 12/06/2022 and 14/06/2022,but to no avail.

Bot: How much did you ask?

Human: Rs 1,60, 000. Rs 40,000 per acre

Bot: What was their response?

Human: They denied responsibility for the loss

Bot: Okay. Did you request them to send a sample of the seeds for inspection as per the legal requirements?

Human: No, I was not aware of the legal provisions in this regard

Bot: That’s okay. I understand It is possible that factors such as weather conditions, water usage, fertilizer/pesticide usage, and soil conditions might have played a role in the harvest not being as expected. Did you get a horticultural officer to check your produce?

Human: Yes, I called the horticultural officer and the report submitted by him stated that there was an inherent defect in the seeds purchased which resulted in the lower yield per crop.

Bot: Have you considered sending them a notice?

Human: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 16/06/2022, but I have not received any reply from them

Bot: Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum?

Human: Yes, I would like to

Bruno1888@gmail.com 9234567891………                                                                         COMPLAINANT  Vs.  ABC Agro Private Limited Represented by its Manager 28/459, 2nd street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos- 37 abcagro@gmail.com 9456716832………                                                                      .OPPOSITE PARTY  COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 35 of CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019 RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH: The complainant, Bruno (PAN Card No. xxxxx xxxxx), aged 46, residing at 32/208, 3rd street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos-20, is a farmer, and has been growing chillies along with rice for the last 25 years in his 10-acre plot of land situated in Cosmos. The opposite party is a well-known and reputed seller of agricultural products including new varieties of seeds, and has been catering to the needs of over 1000 farmers in Cosmos and other places in the country. Over the years, since its inception in 2004, the company has come up with many varieties with benefits ranging from higher yield per crop to better flavor to higher tolerance to adverse weather conditions.  On 04/02/2022 (4th February, 2022), at around 2:30 pm, the complainant visited the office of the opposite party situated at 28/459, 2nd street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos- 37 to purchase the new variety of chilli seeds (AZ456832) offered by the opposite party, which promised a higher yield per acre as compared to the other variants. The complainant purchased 7  packets, each weighing about 50 grams for Rs 3500/-. In total, the complainant paid Rs 24,500/- for 7 packets, and obtained a receipt for the same.  The complainant sowed the seeds in his field, and followed the usual procedure; where special instructions were given regarding the use of the seeds, the complainant followed them to the hilt diligently. After three months, when it was time for harvest, much to the disappointment of the complainant, the increase in the yield was not as promised by the seller; in place of 15 quintals of chillies, he got only 8 quintals.  The complainant then approached the opposite for an explanation regarding the sale of seeds of inferior quality. The opposite party denied responsibility, and further stated that he never gave any assurance with respect to the exact quantity of yield that the complainant would get from the use of the seeds. Additionally, he mentioned factors such as soil conditions, rainfall patterns, use of fertilizers/pesticides as the cause for the shortfall, but did not offer to send to his product for inspection as per the legal mandate even when the complainant requested him to do so. The complainant, on his part, brought the issue to the attention of the horticultural officer, and requested an examination of the same. On 04/06/2022, the officials conducted an examination and concluded in their report that the product sold was indeed of inferior quality and the lower-than-expected yield was due to the same. When the complainant approached the opposite party with the report to request compensation for the material and non-material loss suffered by him. The opposite party refused to accept the conclusions arrived at in the report, and consequently rejected the claim for compensation. Thereafter, the complainant contacted the customer care division of the opposite party, and registered a complaint on 10/06/2022 but when the former never gave a reply, the complainant sent reminder emails on 12/06/2022 and 14/06/2022 but did not receive a response to these emails either. On 15/06/2022, the complainant went in person to the office of the opposite party, and requested payment of compensation to the tune of Rs 1,60,000/- (40,000 per acre for 4 acres) for one last time. The opposite party; however, reiterated the fact that he was not responsible for the lower yield as no specific assurances were given to the complainant. Furthermore, he stated that the complainant should have exercised care and caution at the time of purchase, and could have asked for a sample for inspection, not realizing that one of the exceptions to the caveat emptor principle is when the buyer relies on the specific knowledge of the seller as in the present case. Moreover, the complainant also enquired from other farmers who purchased and used the impugned seeds if they too faced similar issues with respect to the yield per acre. When they replied in the affirmative, the complainant was upset, and decided to escalate the matter as the opposite party was not willing to compensate the complainant for the loss suffered by him. The complainant was therefore constrained to send a legal notice on 16/06/2022 (16th June, 2022) whereby the opposite party was advised to comply with request of the complainant for compensation to the tune of Rs 1,60,000 for the loss suffered by the complainant and Rs 10,000/- as compensation for the legal expenses incurred by the complainant to avoid initiation of action under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 on the ground of sale of defective goods. However, months went by, but the complainant never received any reply to the notice sent on 16/06/2022. Distressed by the indifferent attitude of the opposite party towards the suffering of the complainant, the latter has now approached this hon’ble commission for relief. The complainant, therefore, humbly submits that the present incident is a clear case of violation of the right of the complainant as a consumer to avail good quality products for the money paid, and also sale of defective goods as described under section 2(10) of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 thereby meriting remedy under the relevant provisions of the Act. The cause of action arose in the first instance on 04/02/2022 when the complainant purchased the seeds, in the second instance on 04/06/2022 when the complainant’s harvest was not as promised, and finally on                     15/06/2022 when the opposite party refused to pay compensation for the same. The following documents have been attached as Annexures for the perusal of the hon’ble commission: Original bill/invoice dated 04/02/2022 Report of the horticultural officer (original) Photographs of the harvest Copies of the email correspondence with the opposite party Original legal notice dated 16/06/2022 14) Jurisdiction: As the total value of the consideration involved is less than Rupees 50 lakhs, and the cause of action is in the city of Cosmos, the complaint is being filed with the Hon’ble District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Limitation: That the present complaint is being filed within a period of two years from the date of cause of action i.e date of the incident, as prescribed under section 69 of the Act, 2019 Court Fees: In line with Rule 7 of Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020, no court fee has been paid as the value of the impugned product is less than Rs 5 lakhs, and stipulated three copies of the complaint have been   submitted.      PRAYER The complainant therefore prays: - That the opposite party be directed to pay compensation to the tune of Rs 1,60,000 for the loss suffered by the complainant, and pay Rs 25,000 as compensation for the legal expenses incurred, and also for the mental distress caused to the complainant. that such orders be passed as the Hon’ble Consumer Forum may deem fit in the circumstances of the case.     PLACE:	Signature DATED:	NAME OF THE COMPLAINANT     VERIFICATION  I, Bruno, 46 years of age, male, 32/208, 3rd street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos-20, hereby declare that I have not misrepresented any facts nor have I tried to hide any information in my above complaint. All the facts mentioned herein are true to the best of my knowledge.   Name  Signature  Legal Notice Tanya Shree Advocate Enrolment No. xxxx/2002 No. 46, 3rd street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos-25 Ph: 9765432271                                                                                                                            16/02/2022 To Vista Travel Agency Private Limited Represented by its Manager 32, 7th street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos-40  LEGAL NOTICE Under the instructions of and on behalf of my client Mr. Bruno,  (PAN Card No. xxxxx xxxxx), aged 46, residing at 24/718, 4th street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos-21, I hereby serve upon you the above addressee with the following notice: That my client Bruno (PAN Card No. xxxxx xxxxx), aged 46, residing at 24/718, 4th street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos-21, is a graphic designer by profession, and has been working in H2O Designs Private Limited for the last seven years. That on 04/02/2022 (4th February, 2022), at around 2:30 pm, my client visited the Simala Nagar branch of your company, located in the city of the Cosmos. My client opted for a 15-day tour to the US with the date of departure from India being 01/03/2022, and date of arrival in India being 15/03/2022. The price for the trip was Rs 1,00,000/- inclusive of meals, accommodation and sightseeing, but exclusive of flight fare; the to and fro cost of the flight ticket was Rs 1,15,000/- In total, my client paid a sum of Rs 2,15,000 for one person by way of NEFT (Transaction ID: XXXX XXXX) on 06/02/2022, and obtained a receipt for the same dated 06/02/2022. On 01/03/2022, my client left for the US. Shortly thereafter, on 04/03/2022, he received a call from his relatives in India to regarding some family emergency, so in order to attend to his personal commitments back home, he had to cut short his trip. In furtherance of this decision, on 04/03/2022, he requested you to prepone the date of departure to 08/03/2022, and make all the necessary arrangements for the same. You had promised to reschedule the date of departure, and asked the complainant to transfer an additional sum of money to the tune of Rs 80,000. Immediately, my client transferred the amount and informed the opposite party of the same upon hearing which the latter promised to do the needful. On 08/03/2022, my client reached the airport, and was scheduled to fly with Sunset Airlines from the US to India. However, much to his shock and dismay, the airline officials informed him about issues pertaining to his transit visa, and that he would have to re-book the tickets for the return journey to have a hassle-free flight. Since, he was already hard-pressed for time, he decided to pay afresh for the return ticket which was Rs 50,000 and the time of departure was 6 hours later than the original time of departure. Thus, due to the delay in arrival, my client could not attend to his personal commitments properly. A few days after the incident, on 15/02/2022 (15th February, 2022), my client approached you for an explanation regarding the incident. However, you denied responsibility. You simply said that you had done everything that had to be done from your end, and that issues regarding the transit visa were not under your control. You further directed my client to contact the appropriate persons for the same. When my client pointed out the fact that the money paid was inclusive of visa arrangements, you reiterated the same. Later in the day, my client contacted the 24 x 7 customer care division of yours, and also raised a complaint on the portal. Furthermore, he also availed the chatbot facility that was available on the website for grievance redressal, but all the efforts went in vain as even after 6-7 working days from the date of reporting of the incident, the travel agency refused to comply with his request for a refund of Rs 80,000 paid towards re-booking charges. It is, therefore, humbly submitted that the present incident is a clear case of violation of the right of my client as a consumer to avail good quality service for the money paid, and also deficiency in service as described under section 2(11) of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 thereby meriting remedy under the relevant provisions of the Act.  I, therefore, request you to pay a sum of Rs 80,000/- paid towards re-booking of flight tickets, and also pay Rs 50,000 as compensation within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice failing which I shall be constrained to initiate proceedings under The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 for redressal of my aforesaid grievances and recovery of the aforesaid amount exclusively at your own risk, cost, responsibility and consequences.
