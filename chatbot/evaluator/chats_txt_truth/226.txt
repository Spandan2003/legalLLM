Human: I was provided a non-AC bus instead of the AC bus which was booked. What are my remedies?

Bot: I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Can you please provide more details about the incident? Specify the date you booked the tickets, from where did you book it, and other details.

Human: I booked my tickets on 17th January 2013 for travelling from Thrissur to Chennai on 18 January 2013 in an AC bus through Redbus. I paid Rs. 4, 400 for this. However, the bus which was arranged by the bus provider Maruthi Travels was a non-AC bus.

Bot: Okay. Did you try to contact either the bus provider or the booking agent?

Human: Yes. Upon entering the non-AC bus, I immediately contacted the manager of Maruthi Travels. He promised that he will arrange the A/c bus from Palakkad to Chennai and requested me to catch the bus to Palakkad. Upon reaching Palakkad, the A/c bus did not come. Finally they sent a Maruthi Omni van. Due to this, I arrived late and missed an important test conducted by the college for assessing internals of Semester II. Even after repeated requests, neither the bus service provider nor the booking agent has refunded my money.

Bot: Okay. This amounts to deficiency of service under the Indian Consumer Protection Act, 2019. What do you want as a remedy? Do note that you can also claim compensation for mental agony suffered, the cost of legal proceedings, if any, along with a refund of the amount paid for the cable connection.

Human: I want a full refund of the tickets along with compensation.

Bot: Okay. As your first remedy, since you have already tried contacting both the bus provider as well as the booking agent, you can send them a legal notice. Do you want me to prepare a draft for the same?

Human: Yes, please.

Bot: Okay. Before that please provide complete details of you, Martuhi Travels and Redbus including both of your addresses.

Human: My name is N.Sivasubramanian, S/o.A.S.Narayanan, residing at ‘Lakshmi Nilayam”, TMC 2/1170, Third Street, Hari Nagar, Punkunnam P.O., Thrissur, Pin-680 002. M/s.Maruthi Travels, has its office in A7, Omni Bus Stand, Sakthi Main Road, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, Pin 641 012. M/s.Redbus, has its Branch office at Redbus No. 86, 9B Beside Muthoot Securities, Ashirwad Building, Opposite DD Vyapar Bhavan, KP Vallon Road, Kadavanthra, Cochin-20.

Bot: Okay. Here is a draft Notice.. Please review this draft letter. You'll need to send it to Redbus’s consumer grievance email cc-ing Maruthi travels, which should be found over the internet, along with a copy of your invoice and other evidence. Once you send this notice, they should respond within 15 days. If they don't, or if you're not satisfied with their response, the next step you can take is to file a complaint with the consumer court. NOTICE  N. Sivasubramanian S/o A.S. Narayanan 'Lakshmi Nilayam' TMC 2/1170, Third Street Hari Nagar, Punkunnam P.O. Thrissur - 680002  18th March 2023  TO, M/s Maruthi Travels A7, Omni Bus Stand Sakthi Main Road Coimbatore - 641012  M/s Redbus No. 86, 9B Beside Muthoot Securities Ashirwad Building, Opposite DD Vyapar Bhavan KP Vallon Road, Kadavanthra Cochin - 682020  IN RE: Deficiency in providing booked AC bus service from Thrissur to Chennai on 18th January 2023  Dear Sirs,  This is to bring to your kind notice that on 17th January 2023, I had booked tickets through Redbus (Booking ID XXXXXX) for travelling from Thrissur to Chennai on 18th January 2023 by an AC bus operated by M/s Maruthi Travels, paying a total consideration of Rs.4,400/- in cash.  However, the bus provided by M/s Maruthi Travels for the aforementioned journey was a non-AC bus, contrary to the booked service. Upon my complaint at the boarding point, the manager promised to arrange an AC bus from Palakkad onwards. But at Palakkad, instead of an AC bus, they provided a Maruthi Omni van to continue the journey.  Due to this deficiency in service, I reached my destination late and missed an important exam, causing me serious inconvenience, mental agony and financial loss.  I have raised multiple complaints with both Redbus and Maruthi Travels regarding this issue, but despite all my pleadings, neither of you have rectified the deficiency in service by providing a refund or compensation.  You are hereby called upon jointly and severally to:  1. Refund the full ticket amount of Rs.4,400/- paid by me 2. Pay compensation of Rs.10,000/- for the mental agony, inconvenience and financial loss suffered by me due to your deficiency in service.  Please comply with the above within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice, failing which I shall be constrained to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against you both under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 at your sole risk as to costs and consequences.  Yours faithfully, N. Sivasubramanian.

Human: How do I go about filing a complaint in court?

Bot: Good question. First, determine the jurisdiction. You have the option to file either in Ernakulam, where you reside, or from where the bus started (Thrissur) or where it finally reached (Chennai). You can also file in Palakkad since part of cause of action occurred there or where Redbus or Maruthi Travels has their registered office. Where would you prefer?

Human: Ernakulam is more convenient for me.

Bot: Great. In that case, you can file it in the Ernakulam District Consumer Court. You'll need to submit several documents, including the legal notice you sent, their response (if any), and any evidence like invoice of tickets purchased and evidence of the deficiency claimed. I can generate a checklist for you. Would that be helpful?
