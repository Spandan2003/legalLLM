Human: I've been facing a lot of issues with the motorbike I purchased from Varun Motors. There are constant repairs and the service provided by them is also not good. How do I take action against them.

Bot: I see. Could you walk me through the events starting from when you first purchased the bike and details of the transaction.

Human: Certainly. I bought the bike on 26th April 2018 from the Varun Motors showroom, a dealer of Bajaj, here in Visakhapatnam. I paid Rs. 2,37,496 for it.

Bot: Do you have receipts of purchase.

Human: Yes

Bot: Could you further mention details of the motorbike you purchased including specific details like model, manufacturer, etc.

Human: KTM RC 390 EBONY BLK(MET) model Motor Cycle and make “KTM RC 390” bearing Engine No. 8-938*50300* and chassis No. MD2JYJYM3JC298161 manufactured by M/s Bajaj Auto Ltd.,

Bot: And when did you first start experiencing problems with the bike?

Human: Almost immediately after the purchase. The engine would become too hot, the bike would fail to start, and it would frequently cut off while I was riding it.

Bot: That sounds frustrating. What did you do when you noticed these issues?

Human: I took the bike to Varun Motors' service center on 25th May 2018. Their mechanics inspected it and told me that the radiator fan assembly needed to be replaced to fix the problem.

Bot: could you please clarify whether the defect was identified as a manufacturing defect after inspection.

Human: No.

Bot: Could you please mention if the service was free or was covered under warranty or was it charged?

Human: Since it was immediately after purchase and considered as the first service it was done for free. However, I was charged for the service charges like labour charges, which was Rs. 5000.

Bot: Could you please mention, if you were provided with any benefits such as free service or free replacement at the time of purchase by the dealer.

Human: I was provided with the benefit of free service for the first three services and free replacement of any part subject to being a manufacturing defect within one year from the date of purchase.

Bot: Do you have receipts of the service charges.

Human: Yes

Bot: Did the replacement of the part resolve the issue.

Human: Yes temporarily. But unfortunately, the problem persisted. I had to take the bike back to the service center on multiple occasions, and each time they replaced the radiator assembly, but the issue was never fully resolved.

Bot: Could you mention how frequently the issue arises by specifying the dates.

Human: After the first service, i.e on 25/05/2018, i went for the second time on 09/06/2018, again third time on 22/06/2018 again fourth time in the month of august 2018, again fifth in the month of sept 2018, the vehicle was stopped in the middle of journey near Sompeta, Srikakulam District and the complainant had to opt for roadside assistance. The service center sent the representatives from Visakhapatnam and took the same for carrying out repairs.

Bot: Do you have receipts of each service.

Human: Yes

Bot: Did you try to escalate the issue with the company?

Human: Yes, I did. On 10th October 2018, I requested Varun Motors to have representatives from the company inspect the bike and either rectify the defect or replace the bike altogether. However, they only provided temporary repairs and returned the bike to me on 30th October 2018.

Bot: And did this resolve the issue?

Human: No, unfortunately not. The problems with the bike persisted, and I had to deal with constant breakdowns. Finally, on 12th January 2019, I sent a legal notice to the companies, but they didn't respond.

Bot: Thank you for providing me with all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.

Human: Firstly, I want the vehicle to be replaced. Because the vehicle is unfit to use irrespective of how many times it was repaired. Secondly, I would like to seek the costs of replacement (Service charges) for providing me with a defective vehicle and charging me for its repairs,  a total of Rs.1,50,000, almost costing me more than half the price of the vehicle. Further, the benefit of free service of the first three services to be extended because it was unnecessarily covered for the free replacement by the dealers. Also I would like to seek compensation of Rs.2,00,000 towards the negligent service and fraud. This is because I suspect the dealers deliberately concealed the fact that the defect was a manufacturing defect and withheld the benefit of free replacement and covered it under free service benefit.

Bot: Based on the above information provided you could file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, or you could also contact the respective State Consumer Helpline Number where you can talk to an agent and address your grievance.

Human: Could you provide me the helpline number

Bot: To be specific, there is a National and State Consumer Helpline Number. Which number do you want me to provide you with.

Human: Provide me with both the Helpline Number.

The complainant took the vehicle to the 4th opposite party on 25/05/2018. The authorized mechanics after inspection informed the complainant that the radiator fan assembly has to be replaced to rectify the issue. The complainant further contends that on 09/06/2018 the vehicle stopped functioning, as such again the same was taken to the 4th opposite party and the radiator fan assembly was replaced again by the 4th opposite party. Likewise within a few days the incident was repeated again on 22/06/2018 and the vehicle was again taken to the 4th opposite party who replaced the radiator assembly again but still the problem was not solved. Further, in the month of August, 2018 when the complainant faced the same problem, the 4th opposite party took the vehicle to resolve the issue, but in vain. In the month of September, 2018 the vehicle was stopped in the middle of journey near Sompeta, Srikakulam District and the complainant had to opt for roadside assistance.
