Human: Hi, I'm Mohammed Jahangir. I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding an issue I'm facing related to a property.

Bot: I'll be happy to assist you with the consumer complaint. Can you explain the issue in detail?

Human: Sure. Here's the background - I had purchased a residential plot in Mahabubnagar back in 2009. It was Plot No. 73, total area 150 square yards, located at Sy Nos. 260, 263 and 264 at Christianpally Sivar. This plot was registered in my wife's name, Shaheda Begum. After purchasing the plot, I constructed a house on it using my retirement benefits. Since the plot was in my wife's name, I got the house constructed in her name too.

Bot: What problem did you face ?

Human: The house that I constructed on the plot was allotted a municipal door number - 14-4-154/3 by the local authorities. My wife Shaheda Begum unfortunately passed away in 2015. After her death, I was left as the legal heir of the house along with our son and 6 daughters. But when I approached the municipal authorities to get the house mutated to my name as legal heir, I found that the house was already mutated to my son's name without my knowledge and consent.

Bot: How did this mutation happen without your consent? Can you elaborate.

Human: It turned out my son had submitted a fabricated gift deed to the municipal authorities, falsely stating that my wife had gifted the house to him before her death. This was completely false - my wife never made any such gift deed. It was forged by my son to illegally transfer the property.

Bot: Right, that clarifies the key issue. Your son used fraudulent means to get the property mutated in his name. What steps did you take after you uncovered this?

Human: I immediately approached the municipal authorities and pointed out the fabrication. I gave them my wife's death certificate and my legal heir certificate proving the mutation was done illegally. I followed up with them multiple times through written and oral complaints.But they didn't take  any action.

Bot: I can assist you with drafting the consumer complaint highlighting your main grievance against the municipal authorities. But you also have the option to send  the legal notice to the opposite party.

Human: Please go ahead and draft the notice. I'll be able to review it and provide any additional inputs needed.  Chatot: Could you please send your address and the address of the opposite parties.  My address is the same as already stated, S/o Mohammad Abdul Aziz, aged 69 years, H.No.14-4-154/3, Occupation: Retired govt employee, Shivashakthinagar,  Mahabubnagar town and district and the opposite parties address is 1.
