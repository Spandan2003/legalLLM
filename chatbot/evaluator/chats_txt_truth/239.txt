Human: This doctor didn’t treat my hip disk of right leg properly due to which I had to go through multiple surgeries.

Bot: I’m sorry to hear about the complications you’ve experienced with your treatment. Have you consulted with another doctor and obtained an independent medical opinion to see whether the act of the previous doctor constitutes negligence?

Human: Yes. I consulted another doctor who operated on me and I got treated properly.

Bot: The multiple surgeries without any treatment by the previous doctor and subsequent recoval by treatment of another doctor shows that the previous doctor was negligent. The treatment by the subsequent doctor strengthens your case if you want to take a legal action.

Human: What legal action can I take?

Bot: You can file a consumer complaint in the appropriate forum for redressal. It is preferable to send a legal notice to the hospital before filing the complaint.

Human: Can you draft a legal notice for my case if I provide you the required details?

Bot: Certainly, I can help you draft a legal notice. Please provide me with the details of your name and address and the name of the opposite party’s name and address.

Human: My name is  Satheesan P.S. My address is Sree Nilayam, Muhamma P.O. Alappuzha - 688525. The opposite party is  Dr. M.A. Thomas of Department – Ortho 1 in Govt. Medical College. It is located in Gandhi Nagar, Kottayam.

Bot: Thank you. Can you please provide me with the details regarding the reason for your treatment, the costs of the same and the issue in it. Further please specify how many surgeries you had to take and the consequences of such surgeries.

Human: I met with a bike accident and underwent treatment in Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha for the fracture in the upper portion of the hip disk of the right leg in 2005. After treatment, when the pain increased as a result of worn out hip disk, I consulted with Dr. M.A. Thomas in the OP department of Kottayam Medical College. On his suggestion, I got admitted in the Medical College Hospital, Kottayam for hip disk replacement surgery on 2nd May, 2016. I was told that the steel disk used for replacement would cost around Rs.90,000/-. As the pain was unbearable and was affecting my job, I underwent the surgery on 10th May, 2016 and was discharged on 21st May, 2016 with advice of monthly review. To my astonishment the doctor informed me that the surgery failed as the disk moved up by breaking a bone. Another urgent surgery was advised and again on 1st July, I underwent 2nd surgery and was discharged on 13th July 2016. On 4th August 2016, on the review consultation doctor told me that there was a slight improvement and as I had difficulty to stand up I was advised to undergo physiotherapy and checkup after two months. Due to unbearable pain, I again consulted the doctor on 29th August, 2016. The Doctor told me that there was a slight deviation in the position of the disk and advised me to use a walker. On 6th October, 2016 the doctor again informed me that the 2nd surgery also failed as the disk slipped from its position and moved upward resulting in the shortening of length of my leg by 3 cm. He suggested another surgery in which part of the bone from the left leg will be used in the right leg to rectify the problem. As my financial condition was not in a good condition, I was advised to meet the doctor when the situation becomes comfortable.

Bot: Thank you for the details. Further also provide the details of your recoval after treatment near the other doctor.

Human: I consulted doctor Sabin Viswanathan of specialist hospital, Ernakulum. On 09th November, 2016, I underwent another surgery in the specialist hospital when the disk was screwed and was discharged on 14th November, 2016. Thereafter I became able to walk.

Bot: Thank you for the details. Kindly, give the specific amount you are seeking in compensation and the deadline for the opposite party to respond. Typically, this is 15 to 30 days from the receipt of the notice. Once you provide these details, I can draft a legal notice for you.

Human: I want compensation and recovery of expenses incurred.

Bot: Can you specify the amount of compensation?

Human: I want a compensation of Rs. 50,000.

Bot: Thank you. Please find the legal Notice. that I have drafted. Please fill in the relevant details as required. Kindly, let me know if anything else is required to help your case.
