Human: I have been facing some issues with VLCC Health Care Limited regarding a cosmetic treatment that I have received.

Bot: Could you please provide me with more details about what happened?

Human: Yes, I'm very unhappy with the treatment I received from VLCC Health Care Limited. I went there for a cosmetic procedure, but they didn't provide me with the treatment that was promised.

Bot: I see. Could you walk me through what happened, starting from when you first consulted them?

Human: I visited VLCC Health Care Limited on 11th December 2020 to inquire about a cosmetic treatment. Dr. Rinku Aher examined me and recommended a specific treatment involving Voluma and stem cell therapy. I agreed to proceed with the treatment, and they quoted me a price of Rs. 36,398 for it.

Bot: And did you go ahead with the treatment as recommended?

Human: Yes, I did. I deposited an amount of Rs. 9,558 in advance on 12th January 2021, and the treatment was done on 13th January 2021. However, after the treatment, I experienced discomfort, and when I received the bill on 15th January 2021, I noticed that they had used Botox instead of stem cell therapy, which was not what Dr. Aher had recommended.

Bot: That sounds concerning. Did you confront them about this discrepancy?

Human: Yes, I spoke to the manager, Dr. Neelima Balla, on 17th January 2021, but she didn't provide any satisfactory explanation. So, I followed up with her via email on 20th January 2021, asking for details about the treatment process and the brand of products they used. Dr. Balla replied on 30th January 2021, claiming that they had used a product called "Micro Gold Botox," which supposedly contained stem cells.

Bot: And how did you react to this response?

Human: I was not convinced because I specifically opted for stem cell therapy, not Botox. Feeling deceived, I issued a legal notice to VLCC Health Care Limited on 9th April 2021, demanding compensation for their actions. However, instead of addressing my concerns, they replied with baseless allegations.

Bot: Thank you for sharing all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.

Human: I would like a refund of the fees with interest of 24%p.a and and a compensation of Rs.5,00,000.

The address of the Opponents for the very purpose is the same as shown in the cause title above. The complainant approached the opposite parties for cosmetic treatment. Dr. Rinku Aher after examining the complainant on 11/12/2020, explained that the complainant will be treated with 1 ml of Voluma and stem cell (20 units) therapy to which the complainant agreed. The complainant was informed that Rs.36,398 will be charged for the said treatment. The complainant has initially deposited an amount of Rs. 9,558 on 12/01/2021, in advance thinking that the treatment will be good. The complainant got her treatment done on 13/01/2021, and has expressed slight discomfort faced post the treatment process. Dr. Rinku Aher suggested that is common and she needs to rest and was discharged immediately. The opposite parties sent a bill to the complainant via email on 15/01/2021, the procedure specified in the bill is Voluma- 1 ml and 10 units (2 quantity) of Botox instead of stem cell therapy as advised by Dr. Rinku Aher. The opposite parties having agreed to provide Stem cell therapy to the complainant instead used Botex without her consent thereby she developed adverse effects like severe headache as well as other health issues from the date of treatment. The complainant, when she questioned the manager on 17/01/2021, Dr. Neelima Balla as to why she was treated with Botox instead of Stem Cell therapy as prescribed by Dr. Rinku Aher, no explanation was given by her. The complainant further asked the manager on 20/01/2021, Dr. Neelima Balla and the staff sent her the details of the treatment process and brand name used by them. Upon which Dr. Neelima Balla replied via email on 30/01/2021, stating that the complainant was given a “Micro Gold Botox” which contains stem cells. The complainant contends that she was promised a stem cell treatment but has given harmful (botulinum toxin) Botex which is against her consent thereby deceiving the complainant under false promise. The complainant therefore issued a legal notice dated 09/04/2021 demanding the opposite parties to pay compensation. The opposite parties having received the notice instead of complying with the terms of notice have issued a reply notice with false and frivolous allegations. The acts of the opposite parties in not providing suitable treatment to the complainant amounted to deceiving the complainant under false promise and deficiency in service, hence approached this commission seeking redress. CAUSE OF ACTION: The cause of action in the present case arose on the day when the complainant realized she was given a wrong treatment, i.e on 15/01/2021. Subsequently it arose on the day the complainant sent a legal notice to the opposite party on 09/04/2021. JURISDICTION: The amount of loss incurred for the wrong treatment provided by the opposite party is less than Rs. 50 lakhs and the complainant resides within the territorial limits of this Hon’ble Commission. Hence this Hon’ble Commission has jurisdiction to try and entertain this complaint. LIMITATION: That the present complaint is being filed within the period of limitation as prescribed under section 69 of the Act, 2019. COURT FEE: As per Rule 7 of Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission) Rules 2020, the requisite court fee has been paid.
