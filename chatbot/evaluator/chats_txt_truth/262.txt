Human: I bought a mobile phone, SIM cards, and accessories for the internet from Reliance Communication Infrastructure for my business (Umesh Enterprises). I have paid a deposit of Rs 25,000 for the same and I regularly buy the same items by paying the requisite cost. However, after 3 years of this arrangement, Reliance suffered losses and has not refunded my deposit amount nor have they paid my commission of Rs 40,000.

Bot: I am sorry to hear that. Please provide the model number, price, date of purchase of the equipment, and invoice number of the deposit.

Human: I deposited Rs 25,000 via DD no. 220264 in the name of RCIL Bangalore.

Bot: Please provide the name and the location of the establishment where you purchased the equipment.

Human: I purchased the phone, SIM cards, and internet accessories from Reliance Communication Infrastructure Ltd., located at AACCR7832C, ST001, “H” Block, DAKC, Thane-Belapur Road, Navi Mumbai - 400 710.

Bot: Have you contacted the establishment regarding this issue and attempted to resolve it directly with them?

Human: Yes, I have contacted RCIL and requested them to refund my deposit and pay my commission but they have refused.

Bot: That must be very distressing. Have you initiated any legal action against the service centre?

Human: Yes, I have sent a legal notice dated 31/03/2022 to RCIL Bangalore but it was returned with the endorsement that the addressee had left. However, the notice was delivered to their Mumbai office but I did not receive any reply.

Bot: This appears to be a case of deficiency of service. Since you have already issued a legal notice to the establishment and have not received any response, there are 2 further remedies available. You can either file a complaint before the specific District Consumer Redressal Forum that has jurisdiction in your case or contact the  National  Consumer Helpline on this number  - 1800-11-4000. A representative will assist you with specific steps over the phone once you contact the helpline. Which option would you prefer?

Human: I would like to file a complaint.

Bot: Before filing a complaint, could you please confirm whether 15 days have passed since you delivered the legal notice and have not received any response?

Human: Yes, the notice was delivered on 31.03.2022 and more than 15 days have passed.

Bot: Great. To file a complaint, could you please provide some details including your full name and age, your father’s name, and your permanent address?

Human: My full name is Umesha S.N. My father’s name is Nanjegowda, and I am 43 years old. I reside at  Sanenahalli Post, Aarehalli Hobli, Belur Taluk, Hassan District - 573 115.

Bot: Thank you. What remedy would you like to seek against the establishment?

Human: I want a refund of my deposit amounting to Rs 25,000 and payment of my commission amounting to Rs 40,000. I also want Rs 50,000 for the hardship caused and deficiency of service by RCIL.

Bot: Thank you. Do you have documents such as bills, photos, etc which can be used as evidence?

Human: Yes, I have a copy of the  DD no. 220264 in the name of RCIL Bangalore.

Bot: Thank you. Since you have paid Rs 25,000 as deposit, and are also owed Rs. 40,000 as commission, your total consideration is Rs 1,15,000 (including Rs 50,000 as compensation for deficiency of service and mental agony). Further, since you live in Hassan and the establishment is located in Mumbai, you can choose to file a complaint either in Hassan or in Mumbai. Where would you like to file the complaint?

Human: I want to file the complaint in Hassan.

Bot: Great. You can file a complaint with the Hassan District Consumer Redressal Commission as the appropriate forum. Would you like a draft of the legal notice and complaint letter?

Human: Yes, please.
