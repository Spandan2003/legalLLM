Human: I ordered and paid for 100kg pepper and 1kg cumin from the opposite party but never received the items. What are my remedies?

Bot: I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Can you please provide more details about the incident? Specify from where you bought it, the date of purchase  and other details you think are relevant.

Human: I ordered 100 kg of pepper and 1 kg cumin in two orders from Real More International via vide order no. 2, 4. I paid the full amount of Rs.21,800/- and Rs. 20,895/-, vide Invoice no. W2, Date: 10/12/2021 in advance. In fact, I was also provided the lorry receipts of the same through Whatsapp and Mr Ashik, claiming to be the CEO of the company stated that the item was dispatched. However, the receipts were fake and nothing was ever dispatched.

Bot: Okay, and did you try to report this issue with the company itself?

Human: Yes, I did report the issue to them several times. In fact, I visited their office multiple times but it was often locked. I even asked them to either provide the product or refund the full amount paid but have received no satisfactory response.

Bot: Based on the information provided, this is a clear case of fraud, negligence and unfair trade practice which is punishable both under IPC and CPA, 2019. Do you want to file a criminal case or you merely want compensation as a remedy?

Human: I only want compensation.

Bot: How much compensation do you want? Do note that you can also claim compensation for mental agony suffered, the cost of legal proceedings, if any, along with a refund of the amount paid for the cable connection.

Human: I want a full refund of the amount paid (Rs 42,695) and compensation of Rs 20,000.

Bot: Okay. As your first remedy, you can first send them a legal notice. Do you want me to draft the same?

Human: Yes, please.

Bot: Okay. Before that please provide complete details of you and Real More including both of your addresses.
