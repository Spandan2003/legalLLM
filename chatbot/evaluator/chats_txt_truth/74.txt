Human: I was delivered a defective power tilling machine which was full of scrap.

Bot: That’s terrible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?

Human: In 2018, I visited a workshop in Kolhapur to purchase a power tilling machine (PTM) for my farm. After seeing a demo, I confirmed I wanted to buy it but could not complete the purchase then due to the COVID lockdown.

Bot: Okay, when did you finally purchase the PTM?

Human: In May 2021, I contacted the proprietor Mr. Inderjeet again to confirm I wanted to purchase the PTM urgently. I paid the full amount of Rs. 1,13,500 via RTGS on 12/05/2021. This included transportation charges.

Bot: Do you have the purchase receipt and payment proof?

Human: Yes, I have all the documents ready. Inderjeet promised to send a brand new PTM after the payment.

Bot: Alright, what happened after you made the payment?

Human: The PTM was delivered on 10/08/2021. But the transporter Avinash Cargo charged me an additional Rs. 4,280 as transportation fee. Also, the invoice from Venkatesh Engineering showed the amount as only Rs. 35,000!

Bot: Strange. So you were charged more than the invoice amount?

Human: Yes! When I called Inderjeet, he said it was a mistake but I should not worry. But the biggest shock was when I opened the package - the PTM was completely defective and scrap! It was not in a condition to be used at all.

Bot: This is clearly a case of cheating and deficiency in service. What did you do next?

Human: I approached them multiple times asking for a refund or replacement with a new PTM but they ignored my requests.

Bot: Do you have any emails or communication records?

Human: Yes I have saved all the call and email records.

Bot: Okay, thank you for the information. You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to Venkatesh Engineering Works. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000. The Consumer Helpline will give assistance regarding how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?

Human: I would like to send a legal notice. Can you help me draft it?

Bot: Certainly. I will need some more information from you to draft a notice. Please tell me your full name, address, age, and occupation.

Human: Sure. Mr. Sarvesh Kashinath Madgaonkar, S/o Late Kashinath Madgaonakar, Agriculturist by Occupation, 28 years old, resident of H no. 17/B, Ucassaim, Bardez, Goa- 403507.

To, Mr. Inderjeet, Proprietor, Venkateshwara Engineering Works, Vishwatara Apartments, Near the Hockey Stadium, Kolhapur, Maharashtra- 416012 Subject: Legal Notice for Fraud and Violation of Consumer Rights Dear Mr. Inderjeet, I, Sarvesh Kashinath Madgaonkar, , residing at Residing at H no. 17/B, Ucassaim, Bardez, Goa- 403507, am writing this legal notice through my advocate to bring to your attention the egregious breach of contract and violation of consumer rights perpetrated by Venkateshwara Engineering Works, under your proprietorship. On 12/05/2021, I entered into a transaction with Venkateshwara Engineering Works for the purchase of a Power Tilling Machine (PTM) for a consideration amount of Rs. 1,13,500/-. It is pertinent to note that the said amount was paid in full accordance with the terms stipulated by your establishment. However, to my dismay and astonishment, the PTM delivered to me on 10/08/2021 was nothing short of a heap of scrap metal, utterly unusable for its intended purpose. This act of delivering a defective and non-functional product constitutes a clear breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for purpose, as guaranteed under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Furthermore, your failure to take remedial action despite repeated requests for either replacement or refund further exacerbates the gravity of the situation. In light of the foregoing, I hereby demand the following: Immediate replacement of the defective PTM with a brand-new machine of the same specifications, free of any defects or discrepancies. Alternatively, a full refund of the consideration amount of Rs. 1,13,500/-, along with reimbursement for any additional expenses incurred, including transportation charges. Compensation in the amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- for the mental harassment, anguish, and distress caused due to your negligent actions. Please be advised that failure to comply with the aforementioned demands within 15 days from the receipt of this notice will compel me to initiate legal proceedings against Venkateshwara Engineering Works, without any further notice or intimation. Any ensuing legal action will seek appropriate remedies and damages, as deemed fit by the Hon'ble Court. This notice is issued without prejudice to my rights and contentions, and any communication henceforth shall be made through my legal representative.  Yours sincerely, Advocate

Human: Thank you. I want to file a consumer complaint; can you guide me?

Bot: Certainly. What is the relief that you would wish to pursue through the complaint?

Human: I want a replacement of the power tilling machine, a refund of the entire amount of Rs. 1,13,500/- and compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for mental harassment.

Bot: Thank you! Before I give further details regarding the complaint draft, do you want to claim litigation expenses as well?

Human: Yes, I want Litigation charges of Rs. 50,000/-.
