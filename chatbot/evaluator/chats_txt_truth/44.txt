Human: The water purifier sold to me was defective? What can I do now?

Bot: I’m sorry to hear that. can you provide me further details about your issue?

Human: I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of Waves who is one of the authorized dealers of Streamz, the manufacturer of the water purifier, on 03/02/2022 and purchased a water purifier for a sum of Rs 8000/- Model Number: AX78945632 Capacity: 5 L The product was installed on 04/02/2022, and an e-receipt for the purchase was sent to my email ID on 03/02/2022. Within a few days, the purifier stopped working, and on 06/02/2022, I contacted the dealer to inform him about the issue. He said that a technician would be sent within a few days to assess the product.

Bot: Did the technician check the product?

Human: Yes, a technician came on 08/02/2022 to check the product. After a preliminary examination, he concluded that there was an irreparable defect in the product which could not be fixed, instead that the product would have to be replaced

Bot: What was your decision?

Human: I asked him to take the purifier with him and get a new one installed as soon as possible

Bot: Did you get a replacement?

Human: Not yet.

Bot: Did you find out from the dealer about it?

Human: I sent an email on 20/02/2022 to find out about the status of the request for replacement. The dealer simply stated that the matter was still under consideration and that the request would be processed within a few days.

Bot: Any update after that?

Human: No on 21/02/2022, I registered my grievance in the customer feedback section hoping that the opposite party would reply at least to the grievance raised on the website. At this point, I also requested the seller to refund the money paid if the latter was not in a position to replace the product. After about three days, on 24/02/2022 (24th February, 2022), I received a call from the customer care team, but they only provided false promises as the product was not replaced within the 5 days mentioned by the latter.

Bot: Have you considered sending them a notice?

Human: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 02/03/2022, but I have not received any reply from them In my case, who is liable? Product manufacturer or Product seller?

Bot: Thanks for the question. Both are liable. Please ensure you add both the parties as respondents in your complaint.

The opposite party no.1 is a well-known and reputed dealer in the home appliances sector, and has been selling a wide range of consumer durables for the last 20 years. Further, the opposite party has multiple branches across the city of Cosmos and in other parts of the country, and has so far served over 1 lakh customers. On 03/02/2022 (3th February, 2022), at around 2:30, the complainant visited the showroom of the opposite party no.1  situated in Jeevan Nagar, Cosmos to purchase a water purifier. He purchased a water purifier for Rs 8000/- and the product details are as follows: Brand: Stormz Model Number: AX78945632 Capacity: 5L Warranty period: 1 year The product was installed on 05/02/2022, but on 06/02/2022, within a few days from the date of purchase, the water purifier stopped working, no amount of trouble shooting done by the complainant was helpful. The complainant later contacted the opposite party and sought an explanation with respect to the supply of a defective product. The opposite party no.1 stated that the matter would be looked into and resolved as soon as possible. When there was no response from the opposite party even after 5-6 days, the complainant called the opposite party no.1 to enquire about the status of his complaint. This time, the opposite party promised to send a technician within 2 days. Finally, on 15/02/2022, the technician visited the residence of the complainant to inspect the product. Upon examination, the complainant was informed that there was a manufacturing defect that could not be fixed, and that the complainant would have to apply for a replacement. Accordingly, the complainant sent an email to the opposite party on 16/02/2022 seeking a replacement for the defective water purifier. In the email, the complainant also elaborately explained as to what exactly happened including the advice given by the technician to get the product replaced. When the complainant did not receive a reply from the opposite party no.1 , he sent a reminder email on 20/02/2022 to find out if the product would be replaced anytime soon given the vitality of the product for the complainant. The complainant specifically asked the opposite party to state the date by which he can expect the product to be replaced. Nevertheless, even after sending multiple emails, the opposite party no.1  refused to reply. It is pertinent to note that the impugned product is of utmost importance to the complainant as he relies on purified water for personal consumption; as result, the negligent behavior of the opposite party no.1 has caused immense mental distress to the complainant. The next day, on 21/02/2022, the complainant registered her grievance in the customer feedback section hoping that the opposite party would reply at least the grievance raised on the website of the opposite party. At this point, the complainant also requested the opposite party to refund the money paid if the latter was not in a position to replace the product. After about three days, on 24/02/2022 (24th February, 2022), the complainant received a call from the customer care team of the opposite party no.1 , but the opposite party only provided false promises as the product was not replaced within the 5 days mentioned by the latter. The complainant was therefore constrained to send a legal notice on 01/03/2022 (1st March, 2022) whereby the opposite party was advised to comply with the request of the complainant to replace the product or refund  the money paid towards the purchase of the product, and pay Rs 5000/- as compensation for the mental distress caused and the legal expenses incurred by the complainant to avoid initiation of action under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 on the ground of sale of defective product to the customer. However, months went by, but the complainant never received any reply to the notice sent on 01/03/2022. Distressed by the indifferent attitude of the opposite party no.1 towards the suffering of the complainant, the latter has now approached this hon’ble commission for relief. The complainant, therefore, humbly submits that the present incident is a clear case of violation of the right of the complainant as a consumer to receive a good quality product for the money paid, and also sale of defective product as described under section 2(10) of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 thereby meriting remedy under the relevant provisions of the Act. The cause of action in the first instance arose on 03/02/2022 when the complainant purchased the product, in the second instance on                     06/02/2022 when the product stopped functioning, and in the third instance on                      20/02/2022 when the opposite party did not comply with the request of the complainant for a replacement. The following documents have been attached as Annexures for the perusal of the hon’ble commission: Original bill/invoice dated 03/02/2022 Copy of the emails sent to the opposite party Photograph of the product Original legal notice dated 01/03/2022 Jurisdiction: As the consideration paid for the product purchased is less than Rupees 50 lakhs, and the cause of action is in the city of Cosmos, the complaint is being filed with the Hon’ble District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Cosmos. Limitation: That the present complaint is being filed within a period of two years from the date of cause of action i.e date of the incident, as prescribed under section 69 of the Act, 2019 Court Fees: In line with Rule 7 of Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020, no court fee has been paid as the value of the impugned product is less than Rs 5 lakhs, and stipulated three copies of the complaint have been   submitted.    PRAYER The complainant therefore prays: - That the opposite party be directed to replace the defective product or refund the purchase money, and pay Rs 10,000 as compensation for the mental distress caused to the opposite party, and the expenses incurred. that such orders be passed as the Hon’ble Consumer Forum may deem fit in the circumstances of the case.
