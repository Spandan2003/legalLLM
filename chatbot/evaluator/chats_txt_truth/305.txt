Human: Hi, I need help with a consumer complaint. I paid for a medical entrance coaching course expecting in-person classes, but they switched to online without telling me. I've asked for a refund multiple times, but they haven't responded. What should I do?

Bot: I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Could you tell me the name of the institute, how much you paid, and if you have any written records of your refund requests?

Human: The institute is Delhi Academy of Medical Sciences Pvt Ltd. The total fee was Rs. 1,16,820. I have email records of my refund requests which they ignored or rejected.

Bot: Given the details, it seems like a clear case of service deficiency. I recommend sending them a final legal notice demanding a proportional refund. If they still don't comply, you can file a consumer complaint. Do you need assistance drafting the legal notice?

Human: Yes, please help me draft the notice. Also, can you guide me on how to file the consumer complaint?

The entire course was supposed to be for seven months and the classes had begun on 14.02.2020 which were discontinued from 15.03.2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Despite several pleas and communications, your institute has failed to make any adequate arrangements or provide a refund, which has resulted in a financial loss and mental anguish to me. Hence, I am finally called upon to demand: • the removal of the said defects in the service • a complete refund of the price/charges paid • payment of compensation for the financial loss/injury/interest suffered due to your negligence.  A detailed account of the financial loss and requested compensation is as follows:  Refund of the fee of Rs. 1,16,820/- along with penal interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of payment of fee to the date of actual refund on account of deficiency in service; Litigation expenses of Rs. 50,000/-; Punitive damages of Rs. 3,00,000/- under proviso to Section -39(1)(d) for causing mental harassment.  I kindly request a sum of Rs. 1,00,132/- to be refunded within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, failing which I shall be constrained to initiate legal action against you for redressal of my grievances and recovery of the aforesaid amount under the statutory provisions of The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, exclusively at your own risk, cost, responsibility and consequences.
