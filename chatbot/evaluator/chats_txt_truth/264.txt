Human: Hi, I have a problem with a sports club I joined. I paid them a membership fee, but they have not provided the promised services and neither are they refunding my money.

Bot: Can you provide me with more details about the circumstances? What were the terms of the membership, how much did you pay for it, and how did the sports club fail to meet their obligations?

Human: I joined the Baroda Presidency Sports Club as a Gold Member by paying Rs. 25,000 as the membership fee. The club representative promised me that I wouldn't have to pay any annual maintenance charges, but I had to pay 7,500 per month as additional charges. No one collected the cheque I had made out for this amount. When I asked for a refund of the 25,000, they refused.

Bot: I understand. When did you pay this membership fee and by what means?

Human: I paid through a cheque on 12/09/2017

Bot: Okay. Based on the details you've provided, it seems that the sports club has violated the terms of the agreement and engaged in unfair trade practices. As a consumer, you have the right to seek redress. You can contact the Gujarat helpline to lodge the complaint. This is their number: 1800-233-0222. Are you considering mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods before taking legal action against the seller or dealership?

Human: No. I want to take this directly to Court

Bot: Before you file a complaint before the forum, you would have to send a notice to the Baroda Presidency Sports Club.

Human: Yes

[Date]  Baroda Presidency Sports Club, Sherkhi, Neat to Podar World School, Gotri- Sevasi Road, Vadodara-390007, Gujarat.   Subject: Complaint Regarding Deficiency in Service and Unfair Trade Practices  Dear Sir/Madam,  I am writing to formally complain about the deficiency in your service faced by me.  This is to bring to your notice the deficient services rendered by Baroda Presidency Sports Club to me. On 12/09/2017, I paid Rs.25,000/- vide Cheque No. 952151 towards Gold Membership fee of your sports club against Receipt No. 1918 issued by your representative Mr. Akhilesh. At the time of enrolment, your representative had expressly assured the following benefits: a) Waiver of annual maintenance charges of Rs.3,000/- b) Provision of a complimentary silver gift worth Rs. 5,000/- in the first month c) Handing over all membership documents and maintenance charge waiver letter. However, after collecting the Rs.25,000/- fee, your club failed to deliver on the promised benefits and services. Despite repeated requests, your club avoided responding to my grievances. Finally, via email dated 26/03/2019 addressed to your Manager Mr. Sameerbhai Shah, I requested cancellation of membership and full refund of Rs.25,000/- paid, but there was no response from your club.  Your club's deceptive conduct of collecting money on false assurances, failure to render committed services, and avoiding all communications is a flagrant violation of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and amounts to deficient services and unfair trade practices.  On account of your aforesaid dereliction of duty and failure and neglect to rectify the same I have suffered losses/incurred expenses which you are liable to compensate to me.  Through this legal notice, I call upon you to refund the sum of Rs.25,000/- membership fee paid with interest calculated @18% p.a. from 12/09/2017 till date of realization, Rs.10,000/- as compensation for miscellaneous costs incurred in pursuing this matter, and Rs.45,000/- as compensation for mental agony, harassment and deficient services.  In case of your failure to pay the above demanded amount within 15 days from receipt of this notice, I shall be constrained to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against your club as per the remedies available under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The costs of such proceedings shall be borne by your club.   Place: Vadodara Dated: _________  Sincerely, [Your Signature] Jagrut Nagrik  [Your Signature] Maulik Joitendrabhai Shah

Additionally, the complainant would have to pay Rs.7,500/- per month for the next 20 years, totaling to Rs.1,80,000/-. However, to make the plan attractive, the following assurances were provided: (i) The usual annual maintenance charges of Rs.3,000/- would be waived completely for the complainant's membership tenure; (ii) In the first month, along with collection of the Rs.7,500/- installment, the complainant would be provided a complimentary silver gift worth Rs.5,000/- free of cost; (iii) All membership documents, including a letter confirming waiver of maintenance charges, would be provided after enrolment.
