Human: Tulip Multispeciality Hospital and United India Insurance have troubled me a lot.

Bot: Hello! I'm here to help you with the issues you've encountered with Tulip Multispeciality Hospital and United India Insurance. To better assist you, could you please provide more details about the problem?

Human: My name is Rajender Singh Malik, and I have a medical claim policy issued by United India Insurance. On 22.3.2018, I experienced abdomen pain and went to Tulip Multispeciality Hospital. They diagnosed an obstructive (L) inguinal hernia and admitted me, with an operation scheduled for the next day. I deposited Rs.5000, but the hospital adjusted the rest from my insurance policy.

Bot: Thank you for sharing that information, Rajender. Could you please provide details about the subsequent events after your initial admission on 22.3.2018?

Human: Certainly. On 1.4.2018, I was readmitted to the hospital, and this time, they said I needed to pay Rs.50,000 in cash as the policy amount sanctioned by United India Insurance was insufficient. I arranged Rs.42,000 and paid it.

Bot: I appreciate the details. After the second admission, did you face any issues or complications related to the operation or your health?

Human: Yes, even after the operation, I still feel pain and a cyst in my stomach. I contacted the hospital a week later, but even after two months, the issue has not subsided.

Bot: I understand. Have you communicated these concerns to Tulip Multispeciality Hospital, and if so, what has been their response?

Human: Yes, I have requested the hospital to address my concerns, especially regarding the extra charges of Rs.42,000, but they haven't responded positively.

Bot: Thank you for providing those details. To better assist you, could you share the specific actions or remedies you are seeking in this complaint?

Human: Certainly. I am filing this complaint to request the return of Rs.42,000 charged illegally and compensation for harassment, deficiency in service, amounting to Rs.one lakh, and Rs.11,000 for litigation expenses.

Bot: Understood. Have you considered mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods before considering legal action?
