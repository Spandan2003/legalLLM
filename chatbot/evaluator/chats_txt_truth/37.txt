Human: I incurred extra expenses on my flight journey from the US to India due to negligent conduct of the travel agency. What should I do now?

Bot: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you provide me with further details about your issue?

Human: As per the original itinerary, my return journey from the US to India was scheduled to take place on the 15th of March, 2022. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to arrive earlier than expected, so I had asked the travel agent to prepone the date of departure to 8th March, 2022. However, due to some issues with respect to the transit visa arrangements, I had to shell out an extra sum of money, and also  could not reach India on time to fulfill my personal commitments.

Bot: How much did you have to pay extra for the return journey?

Human: I was asked to pay Rs 80,000 which I paid on 04/03/2022.

Bot: Okay. What is the name of the travel agency?

Human: Vista Travel Agency Private Limited

Bot: Could you please share your flight details?

Human: Airline: Sunset Airlines PNR details: India UserSA – XXXXXX UserSA to India - XXXXXX Date of departure from India: - 01/03/2022 Original date of departure from the UserS: - 15/03/2022 Rescheduled date of departure from the UserS – 08/03/2022 Flight fare (India to US) – Rs 1, 05, 000/- Flight fare (US to India) – Rs 1, 10, 000/-

Bot: Did you raise the matter with the travel agency?

Human: Yes, I did. I contacted their customer care on 15/03/2022. They said there was no mistake on their side, and that they had done all that was necessary.

Bot: What was the response of the airline authorities?

Human: They could not help me as the journey details were not updated in their system, so I was forced to pay an extra sum of money to the airline directly for rebooking the flight ticket. I had to pay Rs 80,000 for the same.

Bot: Did you consider sending them a legal notice?

Human: Yes, I sent a notice dated 20/03/2022 to the travel agency,  but never received a reply to the notice

Vista Travel Agency Private Limited Represented by its Manager 32, 7th street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos-40 Vistatravels@gmail.com 9456716832……………                                                           OPPOSITE PARTY  COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 35 of CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019 RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH: The complainant, Bruno (PAN Card No. xxxxx xxxxx), aged 46, residing at 24/718, 4th street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos-21, is a graphic designer by profession, and has been working in H2O Designs Private Limited for the last seven years.  The opposite party is a well-known and reputed travel agency in the travel and tourism industry, and has branches across the city of Cosmos and in other parts of the country; since its inception in 2004, it has been offering tour packages to a number of destinations in India and abroad.  On 04/02/2022 (4th February, 2022), at around 2:30 pm, the complainant visited the Simala Nagar branch of the opposite party, located in the city of the Cosmos. The complainant opted for a 15-day tour to the US with the date of departure from India being 01/03/2022, and date of arrival in India being 15/03/2022. The price for the trip was Rs 1,00,000/- inclusive of meals, accommodation and sightseeing, but exclusive of flight fare; the to and fro cost of the flight ticket was Rs 1,15,000/- In total, the complainant paid a sum of Rs 2,15,000 for one person by way of NEFT (Transaction ID: XXXX XXXX) on 06/02/2022, and obtained a receipt for the same dated 06/02/2022.  On 01/03/2022, the complainant left for the US. Shortly thereafter, on 04/03/2022, the complainant received a call from his relatives in India regarding some family emergency, so in order to attend to his personal commitments back home, the complainant had to cut short his trip. In furtherance of this decision, on 04/03/2022, the complainant requested the opposite party to prepone the date of departure to 08/03/2022, and make all the necessary arrangements for the same. The opposite party promised to reschedule the date of departure, and asked the complainant to transfer an additional sum of money to the tune of Rs 80,000. Immediately, the complainant transferred the amount and informed the opposite party of the same upon hearing which the latter promised to do the needful.  On 08/03/2022, the complainant reached the airport, and was scheduled to fly with Sunset Airlines from the US to India. However, much to the shock and dismay of the complainant, the airline officials informed him about issues pertaining to his transit visa, and that he would have to re-book the tickets for the return journey to have a hassle-free flight. Since, the complainant was already hard-pressed for time, he decided to pay afresh for the return ticket which was Rs 50,000 and the time of departure was 6 hours later than the original time of departure. Thus, owing to the carelessness of the opposite party and the subsequent delay in arrival, the complainant could not attend to his personal commitments properly.  A few days after the incident, on 15/03/2022 (15th March, 2022), the complainant approached the travel agency for an explanation regarding the incident. The opposite party; however, denied responsibility. They said that they had done everything that had to be done from their end, and that issues regarding the transit visa were not under their control. They further directed the complainant to contact appropriate persons for the same. When the complainant pointed out the fact that the money paid was inclusive of visa arrangements, the opposite reiterated the same.  Later in the day, the complaint contacted the 24 x 7 customer care division of the opposite party, and also raised a complaint on the portal. Furthermore, the complainant also availed the chatbot facility that was available on the website for grievance redressal, but all the efforts went in vain as even after 6-7 working days from the date of reporting of the incident, the travel agency refused to comply with the request of the complainant for a refund of Rs 80,000 paid towards re-booking charges.  The complainant was therefore constrained to send a legal notice on 22/02/2022 (22nd February, 2022) whereby the opposite party was advised to comply with the request of the complainant for a refund of the money paid towards re-booking charges, and Rs 50,000/- as compensation for the mental agony caused to the complainant to avoid initiation of action under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 on the ground of deficiency in the service rendered to the customer.  However, months went by, but the complainant never received any reply to the notice sent on 22/02/2022. Distressed by the indifferent attitude of the opposite party towards the suffering of the complainant, the latter has now approached this hon’ble commission for relief.  The complainant, therefore, humbly submits that the present incident is a clear case of violation of the right of the complainant as a consumer to avail good quality food for the money paid, and also deficiency in service as described under section 2(11) of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 thereby meriting remedy under the relevant provisions of the Act.  Cause of action arose in the first instance on 04/02/2022 when the complainant asked the opposite party to re-book the tickets, in the second instance, on 08/02/2022 when the airline authorities refused the complainant the board the flight due to transit visa issues, and finally on 15/02/2022 when the travel agency refused to return the money paid towards re-booking charges.  The following documents have been attached as Annexures for the perusal of the hon’ble commission: Original bill/invoice dated 04/02/2022 flight tickets (original) screenshot of the complaint raised on the website on 15/02/2022 Original legal notice dated 22/02/2022 13)  Jurisdiction: As the total value of the consideration involved is less than Rs 50 lakhs, and the cause of action is in the city of Cosmos, the complaint is being filed with the Hon’ble District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. 14) Limitation: That the present complaint is being filed within a period of two years from the date of cause of action i.e date of the incident, as prescribed under section 69 of the Act, 2019 15) Court Fees: In line with Rule 7 of Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020, no court fee has been paid as the value of the impugned product is less than Rs 5 lakhs, and stipulated three copies of the complaint have been   submitted.    PRAYER The complainant therefore prays: - That the opposite party be directed to refund Rs 80,000/- paid towards re-booking charges and pay Rs 50,000 as compensation for the mental distress caused to the complainant.  that such orders be passed as the Hon’ble Consumer Forum may deem fit in the circumstances of the case.     PLACE:	Signature DATED:	NAME OF THE COMPLAINANT     VERIFICATION  I, Bruno, 46 years of age, male, residing at 24/718, 4th street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos-21, hereby declare that I have not misrepresented any facts nor have I tried to hide any information in my above complaint. All the facts mentioned herein are true to the best of my knowledge.   Name  Signature  Legal Notice LEGAL NOTICE BEFORE FILING COMPLAINT To ABC Agro Private Limited Represented by its Manager 28/459, 2nd street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos- 37 Date: [Date] Subject: Legal Notice Before Filing Consumer Complaint Dear Sir/Madam, I, Bruno (PAN Card No. xxxxx xxxxx), aged 46, residing at 32/208, 3rd street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos-20, am a farmer with 25 years of experience growing chillies and rice on my 10-acre plot in Cosmos. On February 4, 2022, I purchased 10 packets of your new chilli seeds (AZ456832) for Rs 35,000, expecting higher yields as promised. Despite following all instructions meticulously, my harvest after three months was disappointingly low - only 8 quintals instead of the expected 15 quintals. When I approached you for an explanation, you denied responsibility and refused to have the product inspected. I then had the horticultural officer examine the situation, who concluded on June 4, 2022, that the inferior quality of the seeds was indeed responsible for the low yield. However, you rejected this report and my claim for compensation. I persistently tried to resolve this issue through various channels. I contacted your customer care on June 10, 2022, and sent follow-up emails on June 12 and 14, all of which went unanswered. On June 15, I visited your office in person, requesting compensation of Rs 1,60,000 (Rs 40,000 per acre for 4 acres), but you again denied responsibility. You suggested I should have exercised more caution during purchase, disregarding the fact that I relied on your specific knowledge as the seller. I also discovered that other farmers who used the same seeds experienced similar issues, further confirming the defective nature of your product. I firmly believe this incident constitutes a clear violation of my rights as a consumer to receive quality products for my money. It also represents a case of sale of defective goods as defined under Section 2(10) of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019. Your refusal to acknowledge the problem, provide proper customer service, or offer fair compensation has left me with no choice but to escalate this matter. I am entitled to remedy under the relevant provisions of the Act, and I urge you to reconsider your position and take immediate action to rectify this situation. Your prompt attention and fair resolution of this issue will be greatly appreciated. I, therefore, request you pay compensation to the tune of Rs 1,60,000 for the loss suffered by the complainant, and pay Rs 50,000 as compensation for the mental distress caused within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice failing which I shall be constrained to initiate proceedings under The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 for redressal of my aforesaid grievances and recovery of the aforesaid amount exclusively at your own risk, cost, responsibility and consequences. I hereby demand the following: pay compensation to the tune of Rs 1,60,000 for the loss suffered . pay Rs 50,000 as compensation for the mental distress caused You are hereby given a period of 15 days from the receipt of this notice to comply with the demands stated above. Failure to do so will leave me with no option but to initiate legal proceedings, including filing a complaint under the statutory provisions of The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, at your own risk, cost, responsibility, and consequences. This notice is issued with the expectation of a prompt and fair resolution to avoid unnecessary legal actions. I trust that you will consider this matter seriously and act accordingly. Yours sincerely, Bruno [Your Signature]   Affidavit  AFFIDAVIT I, Bruno, 46 years of age, Male, 32/208, 3rd street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos-20 do hereby solemnly affirm and declare as under: That the facts stated in the complaint petition paras 1 to 10 in Bruno v ABC Agro Private Limited, represented by its manager, being filed before the Hon’ble District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (Cosmos) are true to the best of my knowledge and based on the records maintained by me, which I believe to be true.
