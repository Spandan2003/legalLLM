Human: Hi, I had paid a photographer an advance for video and photography services for my son's marriage reception, but when I cancelled he did not refund the advance.

Bot: How much was the advance that you paid him and when?

Human: I paid the advance of Rs. 15,000 to Mr. Shah through cheque no. 129998 dated 01/08/2018.

Bot: Okay. When and how did you inform Mr. Shah about cancelling the services?

Human: I informed him in October 2018 and requested a refund. He replied on Whatsapp with “no problem” but he never gave the money back

Bot: Okay. Do you have any evidence of making the payment and requesting a refund (receipts, emails, text messages, etc.)?

Human: I have a copy of the cancelled cheque as evidence of payment. I also have copies of WhatsApp messages and emails where I requested a refund after cancellation. Additionally, I sent a registered post letter to him on 13/08/2019 demanding the refund.

Bot: I see. Based on the details you've provided, you have a valid case for seeking a refund and compensation under consumer protection laws. Are you considering mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods before taking legal action against the seller or dealership?

Human: What is that?

Bot: Mediation is like a way to solve problems without going to court. In mediation, there are neutral people called mediators who help both sides talk and find a solution everyone agrees on. The Consumer Court can suggest mediation. But for this to happen, both sides must say yes to mediation. The process is similar to what I explained earlier, but in this case, the court picks the mediators. If everyone doesn't agree on a solution during mediation, then the case goes back to court for a decision. It is your choice as to what method you want to pursue.

Human: What are my other options?

Bot: You can file a complaint before the Consumer Forum that has jurisdiction to hear your case. You can contact the Gujarat Helpline as well to lodge the complaint. This is their number: 1800-233-0222.

Human: How do I go directly to court?

Bot: Before you file a complaint before the forum, you would have to send a notice to the opposite party. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, or if you do not receive a response from them at all, you can initiate legal action by approaching the consumer court. Do you want me to draft a notice for you?

Human: Yes. Draft a legal notice for me.

Bot: In that case, I would require additional details such as your full name and address, the full name and address of Mr. Vishal Shah.

Human: My name is Dr. V.K. Agrawal, and I live at 3A Deepika Society No.01, Nr. Water Tank, Karelibaug, Vadodara - 390022. The opposite party is Mr. Vishal Shah, B-304, Keshav Residency, Nr. Jayratna Char Rasta, Resides Reliance Petrol Pump, Vadodara-390001.

Bot: Thank you. Do you know the amount of compensation you want to demand?

Human: Yes. I want a refund of Rs. 15,000/- towards the advance paid by me with interest @ 18% per annum till realisation and Rs. 10,000/- towards mental agony and harassment.

Bot: Do you want to send the notice physically or via email? If you want to send it via email, please provide me with the email ID that can be used by Mr. Vishal Shah if they want to send a reply.

Human: I will send it physically.

Bot: Thank you. You can access the Notice. here. Please keep in mind that your signature is required in the notice.
