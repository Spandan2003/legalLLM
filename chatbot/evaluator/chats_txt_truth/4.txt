Human: I availed a housing loan from IDBI Bank and for the purpose of security, I have submitted my property documents. After clearing the loan also they have not returned my documents. How do I resolve it.

Bot: I see. Can you provide me with more details about the loan and the documents in question.

Human: Certainly. I took a housing loan of Rs. 7,14,341 from IDBI Bank back on August 31, 2009 and I have submitted my property documents as security against the loan. Over the years, I've diligently repaid the loan, and by March 2020, I had completely cleared it. As per the terms, the bank issued me a clearance letter on December 23, 2020. Despite clearing the loan and issue of clearance letter the bank failed to return my property documents.

Bot: Could you please mention what are all the documents that you have submitted specifying details like document number, date of the document,  if any.

Human: Approved Plan, Cash receipt, Sale Deed bearing No. 1317/1957, Death Certificate No.0099781 dated 29/03/1980, EC dated 01/01/1992 to 17/08/2009, EC dated 01/01/1983 to 17/09/2009, IDBI Policy No. 4000128090, Proceedings dated 16/05/1990, Gift Deed bearing No.3985/2009, Sale Deed bearing No. 3396 dated 09/09/2009, Sale agreement dated 13/08/2009.

Bot: Do you happen to have any records of your communication with the bank regarding the return of these documents.

Human: Yes, I do. I sent a legal notice to the bank on February 2, 2021, requesting the return of the documents. The bank received the notice on February 4, 2021.

Bot: Understood. And did you receive any response from the bank after sending the legal notice.

Human: Yes, I did. Instead of complying with my request, the bank sent me a reply notice on March 3, 2021, stating that some of the documents, including the Sale Deed and Gift Deed, were partially damaged, while others were completely destroyed in a fire accident that occurred in Mumbai on December 11, 2017.

Bot: I see. Can you tell me more about the contents of the bank's reply notice.

Human: The bank mentioned in their reply that the fire caused damage to the documents stored in the premises of SHCIL, and as a result, some were partially damaged, while others were completely destroyed.

Bot: Thank you for providing that information. Could you explain to me how this situation has affected you personally.

Human: Certainly. The value of my property is directly linked to the availability and condition of these documents. Without them, the value of my property has significantly decreased, causing me substantial financial loss and mental anguish.

Bot: I understand. Could you specify the amount of compensation you're seeking from the bank for the damage caused to your property documents?

Human: Yes, I'm seeking compensation of Rs. 18,00,000 for the damage to the original documents, Rs. 1,00,000 for the mental agony I've endured, and an additional Rs. 10,000 for costs incurred.

The opposite parties having received the documents issued acknowledgement of receipt of documents. The complainant has cleared the  said housing loan by the end of March, 2020 and the opposite parties issued a clearance letter acknowledging the same  on 23/12/2020. The opposite parties failed to return the documents despite repeated requests from the complainant. The complainant issued a legal notice to opposite parties on 02/02/2021 and the 1st opposite party received the same on 04/02/2021. The opposite parties instead of complying with the notice have issued a reply notice dated 03/03/2021 informing that the Sale Deed bearing Document No. 3396/2009 and Gift Deed bearing Document No. 3985/2005 were partially damaged and Certified Copy bearing Document No. 1317/1957 was completely destroyed. The opposite parties further mentioned that the documents were damaged in a fire accident that broke out in the storage premises of SHCIL on 11/12/2017 in Mumbai. To extinguish the fire, the fire personnel sprayed the water on the fire area and thereby some of the documents were totally damaged and some were partially damaged. The complainant contends that the value of the immovable property would be diminished if there are no original documents or if the original documents are damaged. It is further contended that since the documents of the property are damaged due to mishandling the price of the property has drastically come down and has caused huge loss to the complainant. The complainant aggrieved by the deficiency of service provided by the opposite party has thus filed this complaint.

No 20-31-7, AVN College Road, Phaindorapeta, Relli Street, Visakhapatnam - 01, am writing to you in regards to my grievance regarding the non-return of certain crucial documents pertaining to a housing loan availed from IDBI Bank. On August 31, 2009, I availed a housing loan of Rs. 7,14,341 from IDBI Bank, Branch Office, located at D. No 9-14-15, Pydah Chambers, 1st floor, VIP Road, Siripuram, Visakhapatnam - 03. After diligently repaying the loan, I received a clearance letter from IDBI Bank on December 23, 2020, acknowledging the full repayment of the loan amount. However, despite the clearance of the loan, IDBI Bank failed to return several important documents related to the property. Despite my repeated requests for the return of these documents, IDBI Bank has not taken any action to address this matter. On February 2, 2021, I sent a legal notice to IDBI Bank, Branch Office, requesting the return of the documents. The said notice was duly received by your office on February 4, 2021. In response to my legal notice, IDBI Bank, Head Office, situated at IDBI Tower, WTC Complex, Cuffe Parade, Mumbai- 400005, issued a reply notice on March 3, 2021. In the reply notice, IDBI Bank stated that certain documents, including the Sale Deed and Gift Deed, were partially damaged, while others were completely destroyed in a fire accident that occurred on December 11, 2017, at the storage premises of SHCIL in Mumbai. I must emphasize that the non-return of these documents has caused me significant financial loss and mental anguish. The value of my property is directly dependent on the availability and condition of these documents, and their absence has resulted in a considerable decrease in the value of my property. Therefore, I hereby demand the following: Immediate return of the damaged documents with an endorsement acknowledging the damage caused due to mishandling. Compensation of Rs. 18,00,000 (Eighteen Lakhs) towards the damage caused to the original documents. Compensation of Rs. 1,00,000 (One Lakh) towards the mental agony and distress caused. Reimbursement of Rs. 10,000 (Ten Thousand) towards the costs incurred in pursuing this matter. Please note that failure to comply with this legal notice within 15 days will leave me with no choice but to initiate legal proceedings against IDBI Bank, seeking appropriate relief through the appropriate legal channels, including but not limited to filing a consumer complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Visakhapatnam. Kindly acknowledge receipt of this notice at the earliest. Yours sincerely, Mallikarjuna Rao Bangari
