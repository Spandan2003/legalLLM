Human: I was cheated by a tourist agency

Bot: I am sorry to hear that.Can you please tell me more about the incident?

Human: Yes, my husband and I booked our ‘Magical Kenya & Tanzania' package (booking no. 8787 dated 10/09/2018) for our honeymoon offered by M/s Trail Blazer Tours Pvt Ltd. The total package cost was Rs. 5,98,600 for visiting places in Kenya and Tanzania and accordingly we paid the entire amount.

Bot: Do you have the full itinerary and booking invoices?

Human: Yes, I have all the documents. But there were major issues right from flight ticket booking.

Bot: What issues did you face with the flight booking?

Human: Due to their negligence in booking, we had to pay Rs. 1,04,280 extra to rebook flight tickets. Also, they suddenly changed the tour itinerary after we landed there, without even informing us!

Bot: This is clearly a deficiency in service. What other problems did you face during the tour?

Human: The hotel accommodation provided was far inferior to what was agreed in the itinerary. During a jungle safari, the vehicle broke down halfway leaving us stranded. It was a life threatening experience!

Bot: My goodness, this seems very traumatic overall. Were there any other issues you faced?

Human: Yes, the food quality at various accommodation camps was terrible. And finally, they dropped us at the airport 7 hours before departure! It was a nightmare trip.

Bot: This is absolutely unacceptable. Don't worry, we have a very strong legal case here.

Human: The experience became hell when we were dropped at the airport 7 hours in advance before flight departure time. Poor quality of food served at accommodation camps.
