Human: I am being charged an excessive amount for the electricity bill

Bot: That’s terrible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?

Human: Yes, I have a regular domestic electricity connection at my residence. But since the last 6 months, the Goa Electricity department has been issuing bills charging me at commercial rates rather than domestic.

Human: They have excessively billed me around Rs. 2000 every month for the last 6 months by categorizing it as commercial. In total they have collected over Rs. 12,000 illegally.

Bot: Did you complain to the department regarding this billing error?

Human: Yes, I have made oral complaints and written requests multiple times over the last 3 months asking them to correct the billing and refund the excess amounts.

Bot: Do you have any proof of the complaints made?
