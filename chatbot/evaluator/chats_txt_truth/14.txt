Human: I have issues with my SB Account. Can you help me resolve it.

Bot: Certainly. Could you please provide me with further details

Human: I've had an SB Account with the State Bank of India, Dondaparthi Branch for many years. Recently, Mr. Sharma, a Senior Associate of the bank,  advised me to open fixed deposits to receive better benefits. Trusting his advice and my faith in the bank, I handed over three cheques, each drawn for Rs. 7,00,000, to Mr. Sharma to have deposits made in the names of my three children.

Bot: And what happened after you handed over the cheques to Mr. Sharma?

Human: Unfortunately, I did not receive any fixed deposit certificates as expected. Despite my repeated requests and visits to Mr. Sharma, he kept postponing the issuance of the certificates, stating that they were still under process. However, I later discovered that Rs. 3441 each was being credited to my account from 28/11/2017 onwards against an annuity pension scheme, which I never agreed to or signed up for.

Bot: That sounds like a concerning situation. Did you raise your concerns with the Manager or anyone else at the bank?

Human: Yes, I approached the Branch Manager in February 2018 and informed them that I never requested or agreed to any policies. I also mentioned that even if policies were issued, I never received any documents related to them. I explained that had I been served with the documents, I would have been able to cancel the policies within the free look period.

Bot: Have you received any response from the opposite parties regarding your complaints?

Human: Unfortunately, despite sending several reminders between 01/10/2019 and 24/07/2021, the opposite parties did not address my concerns or take any action. Finally, on 07/02/2020, they rejected my request to cancel the policies.

Bot: I see. It seems like the opposite parties have not been responsive to your grievances. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are seeking for.

Human: I would like to seek a refund of Rs.21,00,000/- for the three policies and credit the same into my SB account No. 32906316511, Rs. 3,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony and Rs.20,000/- for costs

The address of the Opponents for the very purpose is the same as shown in the cause title above. The complainant is having an SB Account bearing No.32906316511 with the 1st opposite party for many years. The complainant contended that as advised by Mr. Sharma Senior Associate of 1st opposite party to have the fixed deposit in his branch to get better benefits. Believing his advice and faith on 1st opposite party bank Mr. Sharma, the complainant handed over three cheques each cheque drawn for Rs. 7,00,000 to have deposits in the name of his three children without mentioning the bearer’s name. The complainant further submits that he did not receive fixed deposit certificates. The complainant further contended that no cheque was issued in the name of SBI life Insurance and the proposal form for annuity pension plan was also not filled by him. The complainant contended that he was under the impression that the amounts were deposited in fixed deposits and even after roaming for three months around Mr.Sharma for his three fixed deposits certificates, he postponed the issue inferring that it is under process. However, from 28/11/2017 onwards Rs.3441 each has been credited to the account of the complainant against the annuity pension scheme. The complainant approached the 2nd Opposite party in the month of February 2018, and informed that he never asked for the policies and though the policies were issued, the policy documents were not served.

The opposite parties 2 to 4 taking advantage of the complainant’s old age, invested the amounts for their own benefits without the knowledge of the complainant for their wrongful gain. The complainant requested the opposite parties to cancel the policies as the policy bonds were not reached to his address till date, but in vain. From 01/10/2019 to 24/07/2021 several reminders were sent to opposite parties but they did not heed his request and put the grievance in deaf ear and finally rejected on 07/02/2020.
