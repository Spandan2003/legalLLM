On 07-11-2021, the complainant approached the 1st opposite party with difficulty in walking due to pain in her left leg. After conducting various tests, the 1st opposite party diagnosed reduced bone density in the hip portion of the complainant's left leg and advised her to undergo a surgery to replace the left hip bone with an uncemented artificial structure. The surgery was scheduled for 25-01-2022 and the complainant was admitted to the Medical College Hospital, Kottayam on 21-01-2022 as per the 1st opposite party's advice.

Even three months after the surgery, the complainant was unable to walk properly due to the pain and complications arising from the unauthorized surgery on her right leg.
