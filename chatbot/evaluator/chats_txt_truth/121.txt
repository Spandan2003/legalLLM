Human: I was sold a defective mobile phone. What is my remedy?

Bot: Okay. To help me serve you better, could you please provide me with more details regarding the incident?

Human: On 04/02/2022, I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of ABC Mobiles Private Limited, and purchased a Cenza 6+ bearing IMEI No. 65324519846753 for a sum of Rs 50,000/- On 06/02/2022, two days after the date of purchase, I noticed a deep crack on the top left corner of the display screen, and I had not dropped the phone even once since the purchase.

Bot: I’m sorry to hear that. Have you contacted the retailer?

Human: When I contacted the retailer, I was told that physical damage was not covered, but the point is that the crack existed even at the time of purchase although it was not very apparent/noticeable then. So, when there’s no fault on my part, I should not be expected to adjust with a product of sub-standard quality.

Bot: Okay. Is there anything else you would want me to know about the incident?

Human: Warranty period is one year. Actually, I was first told the crack could have occurred due to the pressure exerted by the tight back cover that the company itself provided, and that I could get a replacement, if needed.

Bot: Did you consider raising a formal complaint with the company?

Human: Yes, multiple times. Finally, when I received a reply to my email, I was told I could only get the phone repaired but I would have to bear the expenses which was not acceptable to me as I needed a replacement.

Bot: Did you consider sending a legal notice?

Human: Yes, I sent a notice on 13/02/2022 asking the complainant to replace the defective product, or return the purchase cost of the mobile phone, and also pay Rs 15,000/- as compensation, but received no reply.

Bot: Do you wish to file a consumer complaint?

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: Okay, could you please tell me where your residence is?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

ABC Mobiles Private Limited Represented by its Manager 2nd Cross Street, Jeevan Nagar, Cosmos-60…………...……………………………..OPPOSITE PARTY  COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 35 OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019 The address of the Complainant for the purpose of service of summons, notice etc is as shown in the cause title above and that of his counsel  The address of the Opponents for the very purpose is the same as shown in the cause title above.  Herein the above-named Complainant most respectfully submits as under,  On 04/02/2022, the Complainant visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of ABC Mobiles Private Limited and purchased a Cenza 6+ smartphone bearing IMEI No. 65324519846753 for Rs 50,000/-. However, just two days after the purchase, on 06/02/2022, the Complainant noticed a deep crack on the top left corner of the display screen, despite not having dropped the phone since its purchase. When the Complainant contacted the retailer, they were informed that physical damage was not covered under warranty. However, the Complainant argued that the crack existed at the time of purchase, albeit not prominently visible, implying a pre-existing defect. The Complainant was initially advised that the crack may have been caused by the pressure exerted by the tight back cover provided by the company and that a replacement could be arranged if necessary. Despite raising formal complaints with the company, the Complainant received a response stating that the phone could only be repaired at their own expense, which was deemed unacceptable as a replacement was sought. Consequently, the Complainant sent a legal notice on 13/02/2022, demanding the replacement of the defective product, reimbursement of the purchase cost, and Rs 15,000/- as compensation. However, as of yet, no response has been received, leaving the Complainant dissatisfied and seeking resolution. This ongoing ordeal has caused the complainant considerable distress and financial strain, necessitating a formal complaint to address the Opposite Party's negligence and lack of accountability. The Complainant has suffered immense harassment, agony and pecuniary loss due to the callous attitude and false claims of the Opposite Parties. His repeated requests and notice have been ignored forcing him to approach this Commission. That the Opposite Parties are liable for the defect in good and unfair trade practice which has resulted in financial loss, harassment and mental agony. IV. Cause of Action; The Cause of action of this arose on 04/02/2022 when the Complainant purchased the defective phone from the Opposite Party.  V. Limitation Period That the present complaint is being filed within a period of two years from the date of cause of action, as prescribed under section 69 of the Act, 2019  VI. Jurisdiction: The complainant resides within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court, so also the opponent’s showroom is situated within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. Hence this Hon'ble Court has got jurisdiction to try and entertain this complaint. The consideration amount is less than Rs. 50,00,000/-  VII. Court Fees: In line with Rule 7 of Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020, no court fee has been paid as the value of the impugned service is less than Rs 5 lakhs and stipulated three copies of the complaint have been submitted.
