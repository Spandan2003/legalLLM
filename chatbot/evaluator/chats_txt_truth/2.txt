Human: I have an issue with regards to my insurance policy. How do I resolve it.

Bot: Could you please elaborate the issue.

Human: My husband is an employee at Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd., (RINL). The RINL in order to safeguard the interests of the employees obtained Group Personal Accident Insurance Policies New India Assurance Company Limited and for the same RINL used to deduct a certain amount from my husband’s salary to pay the premium for several years. In 2016, My husband fell down from a two wheeler and sustained a head injury. He was immediately admitted in the hospital, where he underwent the treatment. He was treated in different hospitals for the past two years and he eventually died. When I went to claim insurance it was denied.

Bot: I’m so sorry this happened to you. Could you please mention when did this incident happen

Human: It happened on 05/04/2016.

Bot: could you please mention further details such as employment details of your husband such as what is his post, what is his salary and of the insurance policy, specifically the amount, policy number, the period of policy.

Human: My Husband worked in RINL as a Senior Foreman, CMM Section with Employee No. 11379. His salary was Rs.50,000. I do not know the premium amount deducted from his salary. But the coverage is for Rs.31,00,000 and the policy commences from 1st april to 31st march of every financial year. Thus considering the period 01/04/2016 to 31/03/2017. The policy number is 62030042160100000008.

Bot: Thank you for sharing those details. Could you please further mention if you have reported the incident to police or got an FIR registered. If so, could you provide those details.

Human: Yes. I have reported to Tekkali Police about the accident on 05/04/2016 who registered the same under Crime No. 48/2016.

Bot: Could you mention the details about your husband’s treatment.

Human: My husband was admitted in the Seven Hills Hospital immediately when the accident took place and got the treatment. Later he was shifted to other hospitals to Apollo Hospital and Manipal Hospital between 06/04/2016 to 23/12/2018 and was shifted back again to the Seven Hills Hospital where he underwent the treatment last.

Bot: Could you please mention further details of the death of your Husband

Human: My Husband died on 27/12/2018 in the Seven Hills Hospital.

Bot: Could you mention the reason given by the insurance company for the rejection of the claim for insurance and when and how they refuse the claim.

Human: The insurance company rejected the claim through a letter dated 27/12/2018 stating that the claim is not payable as the death did not occur within the 12 calendar months and the death was not due to injury of the accident but because of aspiration pneumonia sepsis with septic shock.

Bot: Could you please mention if you have approached the insurance company post rejection of claim or have taken any action against them in any form. If so could you please mention those details.

Human: I have approached the Insurance Ombudsman on 05/03/2020 which was dismissed on 29/06/2020.

Bot: What is the remedy that you would like to seek.

Human: I wanted a full claim of the insurance and compensation for the trouble that the insurance company has caused to me.

Bot: How much compensation would you like to claim

Human: I would like to claim full insurance amount i.e, Rs.31,00,000 along with interest at 12% p.a from date of death till date and a compensation of Rs.4,00,000.

Bot: Noted.. Could you please mention your name , age and address and your husband’s details and the details of other persons whom you want to be parties along with you in the complaint to draft a complaint.

Human: Yes. It would be really helpful.

Bot: Here is the Notice.. To, The Senior Divisional Manager The New India Assurance Company Limited 2nd Floor, Daliraju Super Market Akkayyapalem Main Road Visakhapatnam- 530016 The Manager Claims Hub The New India Assurance Company Limited 4th floor, Pavan Paradise Dwarakanagar Visakhapatnam-16 The Chairman cum Managing Director The New India Assurance Company Limited Head Office, No.87, M.G. Road, Fort Mumbai- 400001 The Chairman cum Managing Director Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited Ukkunagaram Visakhapatnam- 530032 Subject: Legal Notice for deficiency of service Dear Sir/Madam, I, Bammidi Venkata Lakshmi Lalitha, w/o late Nandesam, aged 44 years, residing at D. No. 39-22-80/2, Kunchamamba Temple, Madhavadhara, Visakhapatnam-07, along with my daughter, Bammidi Harita, aged 23 years, and my son, Bammidi Nagasai, aged 21 years, we wish to bring to your attention the deficiency of service and unfair trade practices with regard to my husband’s insurance policy. It is pertinent to mention that my late husband, Nandesam, was an esteemed employee of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), serving as a Senior Foreman, CMM Section, bearing Employee No. 11379. It is to be noted that RINL, as a practice to safeguard its employees' interests, procured Group Personal Accident Insurance Policies from The New India Assurance Company Limited  for several years without any interruption. The policy term typically spans from 1st April to 31st March of every financial year, with premiums deducted from employees' salaries. My late husband, being an employee of RINL, was covered under the said policy, providing a life cover of Rs. 31,00,000/- under Policy no. 62030042160100000008 for the period from 01/04/2016 to 31/03/2017. Tragically, on 05/04/2016, my late husband met with a severe accident, resulting in critical head injuries sustained from a fall off his two-wheeler. He was immediately rushed to Seven Hills Hospital for medical attention. Subsequently, the incident was reported to the Tekkali Police, registered as Crime No. 48/2016. Over the course of nearly three years, from 06/04/2016 to 23/12/2018, my late husband underwent extensive medical treatment for his injuries across multiple hospitals, ultimately succumbing to his injuries on 27/12/2018 while undergoing treatment at Seven Hills Hospital. In light of the aforementioned events, I lodged a claim on 29/12/2018 with the RINL, seeking the rightful sum assured under the policy. However, to our dismay, RINL through its communication dated 27/02/2020, informed us that the claim was deemed non-payable on the grounds that the death did not occur within 12 calendar months and was attributed to aspiration pneumonia sepsis with septic shock and not due to injuries caused by the accident. Such a stance by the RINL has caused severe distress and financial strain to my family, who rightfully expected the insurance coverage to provide for them in this time of need. Therefore, through this legal notice, I demand the following: Immediate payment of the sum assured under Policy no. 62030042160100000008, amounting to Rs. 31,00,000/-, along with any accrued interest. Compensation for the mental agony, financial hardships, and legal expenses incurred due to the unwarranted denial of the claim. I hereby request your prompt attention and compliance with the above demands within 10 days of receipt of this notice, failing which we shall be constrained to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against YOU without further notice, at your risk as to costs and consequences. This is a formal notice issued without prejudice to our rights and contentions before the appropriate consumer forum. Yours faithfully, Bammidi Venkata Lakshmi Lalitha
