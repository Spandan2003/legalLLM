Human: Most of the time my landline phone is dead/not working.

Bot: That’s terrible.. Can you please tell me more about the issues that you are facing with your landline phone?

Human: Yes. I have been facing constant interruption in my BSNL landline service for several weeks now. The line often goes dead and I'm unable to make or receive calls.

Bot: Okay. Did you complain to BSNL about this issue?

Human: I made repeated complaints over the phone and even personally to their staff, requesting them to fix the interruption. After a lot of follow-up, they finally sent a lineman to check the connection.

Bot: And what did the lineman find?

Human: This is the most shocking part. The lineman informed me that the interruption was due to parallel connections installed in my house by BSNL themselves way back in 2006!

Bot: What? The company installed parallel connections without your consent?

Human: Yes! I had no idea about this. The lineman told me that was causing the issues.

Bot: This is unbelievable. Did you raise this with BSNL officials?

Human: Yes, I informed higher authorities about their staff illegally installing parallel connections at my home. But instead of apologizing or fixing the issue, the JTO abused me in public for complaining!

Bot: You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to BSNL. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000. The Consumer Helpline will give assistance regarding how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?

Human: I prefer sending legal notice.

Bot: Certainly. I will need some more information from you related to the matter. Can you please tell me your full name and address?
