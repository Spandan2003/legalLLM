Gayathri 46 years of age, female 20/918, III street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos – 100 Gayathri1888@gmail.com 9234567891…                                                                          COMPLAINANT Vs. ABC Hotels Private Limited Represented by its Manager 2nd Cross Street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos-60 abchotels@gmail.com 9456716832…                                                                     OPPOSITE PARTY  COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 35 of CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 2019 RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH: 1) The complainant, K. Gayathri (PAN Card No. xxxxx xxxxx), aged 46,  residing at 20/918, III street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos – 100, is a graphic  designer by profession, and has been working in H2O Designs Private  Limited for the last seven years. 2) The opposite party is a well-known and reputed hotel in the food & hospitality  industry, and has branches across the city of Cosmos and in other parts of the  country; since its inception in 2004, it has been offering a wide range of  cuisines from Indian to continental. 3) On 04/02/2022 (4th February, 2022), at around 2:30 pm, the complainant  visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of the opposite party, located in the city of the  Cosmos along with three of her friends. At the very outset, the complainant  made a mention of the unhygienic ambience to her friends, but since they had  traveled a long distance from their residence, they could not leave the  restaurant. Thereafter, the complainant placed an order for two sandwiches  and one mosambi juice, and paid Rs 500/- for the same, for which she was  given a bill dated 04/02/2022. After about 10 minutes, the food arrived, and  the complainant and her friends began having the food. When the complainant  had drunk almost half of the juice, much to her shock and dismay, she found  insects in it. When she asked her friends to confirm if they were actually  insects, the former answered in the affirmative.  4) Immediately, the complainant beckoned the manager of the branch and  enquired about the presence of insects in the beverage served to them. The  manager; however, denied the allegation, but never explained as to how they  appeared in the first place in the beverage served. Subsequently, when the  complainant requested a refund of the amount paid for serving food of inferior  quality, the manager said that there was no refund policy. 5) On realizing that any further discussion in this respect would be futile, the  complainant, after taking photos of the item, left the premises and later in the  day, the complainant fell sick with diarrhea and also vomited twice. She then  visited a clinic in the vicinity and incurred medical expenses to the tune of Rs  1000/- 6) The next day, on 05/02/2022 (5th February, 2022), the complainant registered  her grievance in the customer feedback section that was available on the  website along with a request for refund of the money paid towards the food  items purchased, and compensation for the medical expenses incurred. The  complainant also tried to contact the opposite party using the toll-free number  given on the website to voice her concerns regarding the deficiency in the  service provided to the complainant and her friends, but there was no response  from their side. 7) After about three days, on 08/02/2022 (8th February, 2022), the complainant  received a call from the customer care division of the opposite party, but the  response was not any different from the one given by the manager on the day  of the incident. The opposite party neither acknowledged the occurrence of a  mistake nor did they promise a refund of the money paid along with the  compensation sought. 8) The complainant was therefore constrained to send a legal notice on 15/02/2022(15th February, 2022) whereby the opposite party was advised to  comply with the request of the complainant for a refund of the money paid  towards the purchase of the food items, and Rs 2000/- as compensation for the  medical and legal expenses incurred by the complainant to avoid initiation of  action under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 on the ground of deficiency  in the service rendered to the customer. 9) However, months went by, but the complainant never received any reply to  the notice sent on 15/02/2022. Distressed by the indifferent attitude of the  opposite party towards the suffering of the complainant, the latter has now  approached this hon’ble commission for relief. 10) The complainant, therefore, humbly submits that the present incident is a clear  case of violation of the right of the complainant as a consumer to avail good  quality food for the money paid, and also deficiency in service as described  under section 2(11) of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 thereby meriting  remedy under the relevant provisions of the Act.  11) The following documents have been attached as Annexures for the perusal of  the hon’ble commission: i) Original bill/invoice dated 04/02/2022 ii) Original medical expenses bill dated 04/02/2022 iii) Photographs of the product iv) Print out of the customer feedback webpage v) Original legal notice dated 15/02/2022 12) Jurisdiction: As the consideration amount involved is less than Rupees 50 lakhs, and the cause of action is  in the city of Cosmos, the complaint is being filed with the Hon’ble District  Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. 13) Limitation: That the present complaint is being filed within a period of two years from the date of  cause of action i.e date of the incident, as prescribed under section 69 of the Act, 2019 14) Court Fees: In line with Rule 7 of Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal  Commission) Rules, 2020, no court fee has been paid as the value of the impugned  product is less than Rs 5 lakhs, and stipulated three copies of the complaint have been  submitted. PRAYER The complainant therefore prays: - i) That the opposite party be directed to refund the money paid towards the  purchase of the food items and pay Rs 10,000 as compensation for the  medical and legal expenses incurred, and also for the mental distress  caused by the act of the opposite party  ii) that such orders be passed as the Hon’ble Consumer Forum may deem fit  in the circumstances of the case.
