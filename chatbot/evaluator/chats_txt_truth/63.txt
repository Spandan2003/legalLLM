Human: I was stopped from traveling at the airport.

Bot: That’s terrible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?

Human: I had booked a roundtrip ticket from the UK to India with Air India. My return flight was on 14/12/2021 at 8am.

Bot: What was the total cost of the air ticket?

Human: Rs. 90,000/-

Bot: Alright. And did you reach the airport on that day?

Human: I reached the Delhi airport at 4:45am, well in time before the flight. I completed the check-in process and submitted my documents.

Bot: Okay. What documents did you provide at the check-in counter?

Human: I showed them my Portuguese passport, UK residence permit, and OCI card as required.

Bot: You have an OCI card? Are you of Indian origin?

Human: Yes I am of Indian origin but hold a Portuguese passport now. I presented my valid OCI card but still they denied me boarding!

Bot: I see. So despite showing valid documents, they did not let you board the flight?

Human: Yes! The Air India staff said the documents were insufficient. But that is not true. As an OCI cardholder, I don't need a separate visa for India. Still they refused to let me travel.

Bot: That is really strange. Did they give any explanation on why they were not allowing you?

Human: They just said the documents were inadequate but didn't specify anything. I tried explaining my rights as an OCI holder but they paid no attention.

Bot: This seems to be a clear case of negligence and deficiency in service on Air India's part. What happened next?

Human: I had no choice but to miss the flight. I had to purchase a new ticket on another airline at very high last minute rates. It caused me immense financial and mental stress.

Bot: You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to Air India Airlines. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000.

The Manager Air India Having Office at Ground Floor, Dempo House D.B Road, Panaji Goa.   Subject: Legal Notice for deficiency of service and claim for compensation  Greetings, This is to bring to your kind notice that I booked a two-way ticket, bearing E-ticket no. 0983898488076 of the Air India Airline on 26/02/2021. I traveled from the United Kingdom to India on 10/03/2021 and I was supposed to return to the United Kingdom on 14/12/2021. I purchased the ticket for Rs. 90,000/- (Rupees Ninety Thousand only) My ticket was confirmed to travel back to the United Kingdom on 14th December 2021 on flight No. AI 145 at 8.00 a.m. from Goa, India to LHR-Heat through London, and the Airport Authority did not seek any other Information nor sought any documents from me till 14th December 2021. I reported at the Airport at 4.45 am on 14/12/2021 to catch the said flight and at the check-in counter staff of Air India started requesting the immigration status and certificate of registration of overseas citizens of India from the complainant. I showed the staff of Air India at the check-in counter, my UK Residence Documentation, and my certificate of registration of Overseas Citizen of India.  However, despite showing/ producing for verification the said documents, the staff at the check-in counter for Air India did not allow me to board the flight as a result I could not travel; back to the United Kingdom and had to undergo huge financial loss and mental stress/agony.  I was required to be in U.K. to take part in the family celebration and being head of my family, I was required to be present to finalize the marriage of my son who is a resident of U.K and as such this wish of mine could not be fulfilled due to this attitude and negligence of the staff of the Air India and therefore I had to undergo mental trauma and entitled to claim compensation from the opposite party.  You failed to provide efficient services and due to the lethargic attitude of your staff I could not travel back to the U.K.  When I visited your office on 15/12/2021 to inquire about a refund, I was told by your staff that my ticket had lapsed and that I had to re-book the ticket and demanded an additional amount of Rs. 71,000/- (Rupees Seventy Thousand Only) for re-booking. However, I could not make payments immediately, and therefore I was withheld from traveling to the United Kingdom.  Owing to the unfair trade practice and deficiency in service, you are hereby finally called upon to: Refund amount of Rs.90,000/- (Rupees Ninety Thousand only), towards refund of the ticket fare. Compensate for the mental harassment, agony, physical torture, and financial losses suffered by the Complainant on account of the ‘Deficiency in service’ rendered by the Opponents.  Failing which, I shall be constrained to initiate proceedings against you for redressal of my grievances and recovery of the amount. I may initiate both civil and criminal proceedings as warranted by law, besides filing a complaint under the statutory provisions of The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, exclusively at your own risk, cost, responsibility, and consequences.  Place: Tiswadi

Human: Thank you. I want to file a consumer complaint; can you guide me?

Bot: Certainly. I would need some more information from you related to the matter to assist you better. What is the relief that you would wish to pursue through the complaint?

Human: I would want a refund of the entire amount and compensation for mental harassment.

Bot: Sure. Since the value of the ticket paid as consideration by you is Rs. 90,000/- which is less than one crore rupees, the complaint will have to be filed in a District Commission.
