Human: Hello, I am the proprietor of Sharma Superstore and I am from Moga, Punjab. I purchased an AC from Home Solutions for my shop. The AC, since the first day, has not been cooling properly. I informed the customer care service and they told me that the AC did not have gas. After getting the AC filled with gas the problems have continued and Home Solutions has not sent a technician despite telling me that they will. What do I do?

Bot: I am sorry for what you have gone through. Can you give me additional details regarding the date you purchased the Air Conditioner, its cost, and its model?

Human: I bought the AC on 13th August 2021. It is an IFB AC that is 1.5 tons. It cost me 36,000 Rs. On 22nd April 2022.

Bot: Thank you so much. please confirm when you were informed that the Air Conditioner did not have gas and what the technicians told you the last time they checked the Air Conditioner.

Human: I was told by the technicians that there was no gas. After filling the AC with gas, it worked for a while and then started causing issues again. The last time the technicians came, they told me that the AC had a microleakage problem.

Bot: After you were informed that there is a microleakage issue, did the technicians tell you that they will get the same rectified?

Human: Yes, they said that they would get it fixed. They have not sent anyone since then. I have made a customer care complaint and that has been of no use.

Bot: To whom did you make the customer care complaint?

Human: I made it to both Home Solutions and IFB and I also have their acknowledgement of the same.

Bot: Have you contacted Home Solutions and IFB since then to request them to get the AC fixed?

Human: Yes, I have contacted them several times but they have not responded.

Bot: Based on what you have told me, you have been given a defective Air Conditioner. Further, since they have not responded properly to your requests and have not rectified the microleakage problem, there is also a deficiency of service. For this, you can seek redressal, i.e., relief from Home Solutions, which has sold the AC to you, and also from IFB Industries, whose AC is defective.  Let me know what kind of remedy you are seeking and how much you want for the same.

Human: I want a replacement along with compensation for mental agony and litigation expenses. For mental agony, I think 50,000 Rs. is reasonable.

Bot: In order to get the relief that you are seeking, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Forum which has jurisdiction to hear your case. You can also go for mediation or contact the Punjab State Consumer Helpline to assist you in this regard. You can find the contact number of the Punjab State Consumer Helpline here. Please feel free to ask me for any clarifications regarding each of the options I have presented to you.

Human: What will happen if I call the state consumer helpline?

Bot: The Punjab State Consumer Helpline will hear your grievance and will guide you by providing the steps involved in filing a case. They will also render advice regarding the strength of your case.

Human: What about mediation?

Bot: mediation is a form of settling disputes outside courts. In mediation, neutral third persons called mediators assist the parties in arriving at an amicable settlement. The mediators cannot decide the case but can only aim for an amicable settlement between the parties. If the parties do not agree for a settlement, then the mediation process comes to an end, resulting in the parties having to seek other methods of settling their dispute, including going to court. Aggrieved Consumer; What is the guarantee that Home Solutions and IFB will come for an amicable settlement? It is difficult to predict if Home Solutions and IFB will come for a settlement. The same depends on the mediation process and the terms and conditions that are placed by both sides for settlement. While there is a chance that there will be an amicable settlement based on the terms you are seeking, there is no guarantee for the same.

Human: If there is no guarantee, then I want to file a complaint before the Consumer Forum.

Bot: Got it. Before you file a complaint before the forum, you would have to send a fifteen-day notice to Home Solutions and IFB. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, or if you do not receive a response from them after a period of fifteen days, you can initiate legal action by approaching the consumer court. Do you want me to draft a notice for you?

Human: Yes, it will be nice if you can draft a notice.

Bot: In that case, I require additional details such as your full name, address, and contact details.

Human: My name is Gurdarshan Sharma, and I reside in Ward No. 27, Jalandhar Colony, Kotkapura Road, Moga. My father’s name is Jagdish Rai. My phone number is 7894232566.

Bot: additionally, can you confirm the full name and address of Home Solutions and the full name of IFB Industries and its address? I also require the Invoice number and the other particulars of the purchase. Or else, you can upload the invoice here.

Human: The full name of Home Solutions is Home Solutions Street. Address- No.9, New Town, Opposite Dharamshala Lal Chand, Moga. IFB Industries Limited (Home Appliances Division), L 1, Verna Electronic City, Verna, Salcete, Goa, 403722. (upon uploading the invoice)

Bot: Thank you. The notice must specify the relief that you are seeking. Here, you are seeking a replacement for the Air Conditioner along with compensation for mental agony. Is it okay if the notice directs the initiation of the replacement and the payment of compensation for mental agony within fifteen days of the opposite party receiving it? This is because the period of the notice is fifteen days.

Human: Yes, that is not an issue at all.

Bot: Thank you. Do you want to send the notice electronically or by post? I would require your address if you want to send a physical copy, or your email ID if you want to send the notice electronically. The email ID that you gave me can be used by Home Solutions and IFB Industries if they want to send a reply.

Human: I want to send it by email. Their response can also be via email.

Bot: If that is the case, kindly give me the email address to which you want them to send a reply.

Human: abc@gmail.com

Bot: Based on the information you have provided me, I have drafted a Notice.. Please keep in mind that your signature is required in the notice. You can either take a printout of the notice and sign it, or else you can e-sign it. Also mention the date in the notice before you send it. If you do not get a satisfactory response or if you do not get a response within fifteen days, you can file a complaint before the consumer forum. Do you want me to guide you on how you can file a complaint before the consumer forum?

The model of the Air Conditioner is 1.5 tons, and it has been continuously experiencing cooling issues since the day of purchase. On 22nd April 2022, technicians informed us that the Air Conditioner had no gas. After refilling the gas, it worked for a while and then started malfunctioning again. The technicians identified a microleakage problem during the last service visit. Despite repeated requests, no further action has been taken to rectify the microleakage issue. The deficiency in the services provided by Home Solutions and the defective product sold by IFB Industries Limited has caused mental agony and financial losses to Sharma Superstore. You are hereby finally called upon to: Replace the defective Air Conditioner; and Pay compensation to the tune of 50,000 Rs. for the mental agony undergone by myself; Within fifteen days of the receipt of this notice. Failing which, I shall be constrained to initiate proceedings against you for redressal of my grievances and recovery of the amount.

Human: I prefer Moga.

Bot: Got it. In that case, do you want me to draft a pre-filled complaint that you can use?

Human: Yes, it will be great if you can draft a complaint which I can use.

Bot: Great! In addition to the invoice that you have already given me, do you have any other documents to prove that there was deficiency of service.  Any messages exchanged between you and the opposite parties about getting the AC repaired and any proof that you made a customer care complaint is sufficient for the same.

Human: Yes, I have messages that I sent to Home Solutions and to IFB saying that the AC is defective. I also have their response saying that they will send a technician to repair the micro leakage problem. I also have the customer care complaint and their acknowledgement

Bot: Great, you can attach the messages, the invoice and the customer care complaint with its acknowledgement here. (Upon uploading documents) Thank you.
