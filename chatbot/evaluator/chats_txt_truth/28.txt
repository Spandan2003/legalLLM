Human: My Samsung LED TV broke in the checked- in baggage at the airport.

Bot: Okay Mr. Murugesan, before we begin discussing the specifics of your case, I'd like to get some background information. What do you do for a living? This helps provide context when drafting the complaint.

Human: I'm a professional cricket player and represent the Tamil Nadu Ranji cricket team in domestic tournaments.

Bot: Can you please explain to me, in your own words, what is the complaint about?

Human: On January 29, 2017 I was returning from Saudi Arabia to Trichy, India via a connecting flight in Mumbai. When I landed in Mumbai around 6am and went to collect my checked-in baggage for the connecting flight, I found my suitcase was damaged and open. To my shock, the Samsung LED TV I had carefully packed in the baggage was completely smashed and broken.

Bot: Can you please tell me, what did you do after discovering the damage?

Human: Well, after seeing the damage, I immediately approached the Jet Airways staff present in the baggage area in Mumbai. I reported the damage to them. The staff gave me a baggage damage report with the file number BOM9W55305 as proof of my complaint. They assured me they would investigate and resolve the matter and that I would be compensated with either a new TV or equivalent cash when I reached Trichy.

Bot: what happened when you arrived in Trichy - were you provided any compensation as assured?

Human: No, unfortunately not. When I reached Trichy airport, Jet Airways did not provide any replacement TV or cash compensation, even though they had promised to do so in Mumbai.

Bot: Apologies you had to face that additional stress. Can you please tell me if you followed up with Jet Airways subsequently regarding compensation?

Human: Yes, I did follow up multiple times. On February 10, 2017 I emailed Jet Airways customer care informing them about the baggage damage and lack of compensation. They responded saying they would address my query in 24 hours, but never did. After waiting patiently for over 2 months, I sent Jet Airways a legal notice on April 3, 2017 demanding compensation.

Bot: Did Jet Airways respond to your legal notice and offer a resolution?

Human: They sent a very late reply to my notice on May 5, 2017. In their reply they asked for documents like my ticket and boarding pass which I had already provided earlier.

Bot: I appreciate you sharing all those details. Just to confirm, do you have copies of the supporting documents like damage report, legal notice, Jet Airways' reply etc which can be attached as evidence to the complaint?

Human: Yes, I have all the relevant documents and can provide copies - the damage report, TV cash memo, flight and excess baggage tickets, email correspondence, legal notice and Jet's reply. I can share these as exhibits to support the complaint.

Bot: That is very helpful. Those documents will strengthen your case. A few more questions - what compensation amount are you seeking through the consumer complaint?

Human: I would like to seek Rs. 50,000 as compensation for the damaged TV, Rs. 30,000 for mental harassment, Rs. 10,000 for deficiency in service and Rs. 10,000 as litigation charges.

Bot: Got it. And lastly, can you please confirm your full residential address for the complaint drafting? Also, which consumer court do you want to file the complaint in, based on whose jurisdiction?

Human: My full address is - M. Murugesan, S/o Muniyandi, D.No.4/150, Ayyanarpuram, Chinthamani Road, Madurai District.

Bot: As you reside in Madurai, the consumer complaint can be filed in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Madurai, you can also file it in Trichy and Mumbai where the opposite party office is located. Where would you like to file the complaint?

Human: I would like to file a complaint in Madurai.

Bot: Kindly upload all the documents that you feel can be helpful to draft the complaint. Also I suggest you send one more legal  notice to the opposite party and then proceed with complaint. Would you like me to draft a notice?

Human: Yes, Kindly draft the complaint and notice.  I have uploaded the documents.

Bot: Thank you. On the basis of the documents that you have given me, I have drafted a pre-filled Notice. and the Complaint.. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same? BEFORE THE HON’BLE DISTRICT CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL COMMISSION AT MADURAI COMPLAINT No..................of 20..... IN THE MATTER OF: M.Murugesan, S/o. Muniyandi, Aged: 35 Occupation: Cricketer D.No.4/150, Ayyanarpuram, Chinthamani Road, Madurai District.							………………Complainant Versus  1.

The Manger, Represented by Baggage Service Unit, Jet Airways India Limited, Trichy, 3. The Manger, Represented by Baggage Service Unit, Jet Airways India Limited, Madurai,								…………..Opposite parties  COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 35 of CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MOST RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH: The address of the Complainant for the purpose of service of summons, notice, etc is as shown in the cause title above and that of his counsel  The address of the Opponents for the very purpose is the same as shown in the cause title above.  Herein the above-named Complainant most respectfully submits as under,  The complainant is a cricket player, and represents Tamil Nadu Ranji Cricket team in domestic tournaments. The complainant is a customer of the opposite party Jet Airways and regularly uses their service for commuting. On 29.01.2017 the complainant was traveling from Saudi to Trichy via Mumbai in the opposite party Airways. The plane landed in Mumbai on the same day around 6am. The complainant was waiting to collect the checked-in baggage for his connecting flight. When the luggage arrived at the baggage counter the complainant found that his suitcase was damaged and open. The complainant was shocked to see that the Samsung LED TV which he had carefully packed in the baggage was badly damaged. The complainant approached Jet Airways staff present in Mumbai and reported the incidence of the lost baggage. Subsequently, the staff gave him a baggage damage report vide File No. BOM9W55305 (Exhibit A1), and ensured the complainant that they would properly investigate the matter and give a peaceful resolution. The opposite party  1 gave an assurance to the complainant that he would be compensated the same either by a new TV or with equivalent cash as soon as he reached the Trichy Airport. Believing on the assurance the complainant left the broken baggage with the opposite party 1. However, on reaching Trichy airport, the complainant was not provided with any replacement for the broken TV or equivalent cash as promised by the staff of the opposite party. This caused immense mental agony and hardship to the complainant. On 10.7.17 The complaint approached the customercare of Jet Airways through email and informed them about the incident that took place at the baggage counter in Mumbai. The opposite party acknowledged the complaint via emails sent on the same date 10.07.17 and gave an assurance that the query would be responded to on 24  hrs. Subsequently, on 12.07.17 the opposite party again retreated that they would revert to the complainant within 48 hrs. But till date neither the 1st nor the 2nd opposite party have made any response to the complainant nor have compensated the complainant for the unfair trade practice adopted on the part of the opposite party. The complainant patiently waited for over 2 months, but with no hope of resolution to be provided by the opposite party sent a legal notice dated 03.04.2017 to Jet Airways (Exhibit A6) i,e opposite party 1,2 and 3. The opposite pary 2 and 3 did not respond to the legal notice sent by the complainant. The opposite party 1 sent a very late reply dated  05.05.2017 (Exhibit A7), denying any responsibility for the damage to the baggage. Instead the opposite party asked for the documents like board pass and ticket to enquire into the matter. It is submitted that the documents asked by the opposite party in the reply to the legal notice were already sent to the opposite party along with legal notice dated 17.7.17. The complainant states that the late reply to the legal notice by the opposite party and asking for the documents already available in their possession, is an attempt to defeat and delay the genuine claim of the complainant. It is prima facie evident that Jet Airways has indulged in deficiency in service and unfair trade practice by - a) Damaging my baggage and not securing it properly during transit b) Not providing prompt resolution or compensation for the damaged TV as promised c) Delaying and avoiding my complaint through vague emails and ignoring my legal notice. The conduct of the opposite party has caused distress and mental agony to the complainant. Hence, the complainant has approached the hon’ble forum for proper remedy. CAUSE OF ACTION: The cause of action arose when the complainant first discovered the damage to their suitcase and the Samsung LED TV upon landing at Mumbai airport on January 29, 2017. The cause of action again arose when customer care did not resolve the grievance of the complainant. JURISDICTION: The amount of loss incurred for the deficiency in service provided by the opposite party is less than Rs. 50 lakhs and the complainant resides within the territorial limits of this Hon’ble Commission. Hence this Hon’ble Commission has jurisdiction to try and entertain this complaint. COURT FEE: The Complainant is complying with the Court Fees Mandated under Rule 7 of the Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020. PRAYER: In light of the above, I humbly pray to the Hon'ble Forum to allow my complaint and direct Jet Airways to: a) Pay compensation of Rs. 50,000 for my damaged TV b) Pay Rs. 30,000 for mental agony caused c) Pay Rs. 10,000 for deficiency in service d) Pay Rs. 10,000 as litigation charges EVIDENCE: I am attaching the following documents as evidence: Damage Report dated 29.01.2017 (Exhibit A1) TV Cash Memo (Exhibit A2) Excess Baggage Ticket (Exhibit A3) Flight Ticket (Exhibit A4) Emails (Exhibit A5) Legal Notice (Exhibit A6) Reply from Jet Airways (Exhibit A7)   VERIFICATION:  I solemnly M.Murugesan, S/o. Muniyandi, Aged: 35 Occupation: Cricketer D.No.4/150, Ayyanarpuram, Chinthamani Road, Madurai District. affirm that the facts stated above are true to the best of my knowledge.

To, The Manager, Baggage Service Unit, Jet Airways India Limited, Siroya Centre, Sahar Airport, Andheri East, Mumbai – 400099  Sub: Legal Notice for deficiency in service and damages caused  Dear Sir/Madam,  This is to bring to your kind notice that I am serving this legal notice to you regarding the damages caused to my personal property during air travel on your airline.  I boarded a Jet Airways flight from Saudi to Trichy via Mumbai on 29.01.2017. Upon landing at Mumbai Airport at around 6 am, I discovered that my checked-in baggage was damaged and open. To my utter shock and dismay, I found that the Samsung LED TV which I had carefully packed was badly damaged.  I immediately approached your staff present and reported the incidence. Your staff gave me a baggage damage report vide File No. BOM9W55305 and assured that the matter would be properly investigated and I would be compensated with either a new TV or equivalent cash when I reach Trichy airport. Trusting this assurance, I handed over the custody of the damaged baggage to your staff at Mumbai airport.  However, on reaching Trichy airport, no one approached me regarding the compensation promised. I sent repeated emails to your customer care on 10.02.2017 and 12.02.2017 regarding this complaint but I have not received any satisfactory response till date.  As per the Carriage by Air Act 1972, an airline is liable for damages caused to passenger luggage in their custody. Your staff has clearly failed to properly handle and secure passenger baggage during transit. No compensation has been provided even after repeated communication from my side. This has caused severe mental agony and hardship.  You are hereby called upon to compensate me with a new Samsung TV of similar specifications or cash equivalent of Rs. 50,000 towards damages. You are hereby given a period of 15 days from the receipt of this notice to comply with the demands stated above. Failure to do so will leave me with no option but to initiate legal proceedings, including filing a complaint under the statutory provisions of The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, at your own risk, cost, responsibility, and consequences. This notice is issued with the expectation of a prompt and fair resolution to avoid unnecessary legal actions. I trust that you will consider this matter seriously and act accordingly.  Sincerely,   (M. Murugesan) Complainant
