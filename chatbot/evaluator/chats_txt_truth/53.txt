Human: I have faced problem with SpiceJet Airline

Bot: That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?

Human: Yes, on 12/02/2021 I had booked air tickets from Goa to Delhi for 4 passengers via Spicejet website. The PNR number was 28283855 and I paid Rs. 5,000 for the booking.

Bot: Do you have the ticket confirmation and payment proof?

Human: Yes, I have taken printouts of the booking confirmation email and payment receipt.

Bot: Okay, so what happened next?

Human: Shockingly, the airline cancelled all the tickets without any intimation or consent from my side. I got to know only when I called to reconfirm.

Bot: Did they provide any reason for the cancellation when you contacted them?

Human: No, the customer care had no clue and gave no explanation on why the booked tickets were cancelled unilaterally. This caused immense harassment to me and my family.

Bot: That is really strange. When were you supposed to travel as per the booking?

Human: The travel date booked was 25th February 2021. I got the cancellation news just 2 days before travel.

Bot: Okay, and what compensation are you seeking from them?

Human: This last minute cancellation led to huge financial losses as I had to book fresh tickets at higher cost. I am seeking a refund of Rs. 5,000 for the booking amount, along with ₹20,000 as compensation for harassment and additional expenses incurred.
