Human: I was served unhygienic food at the restaurant.

Bot: Can you please explain in detail as to when you went to the restaurant and how the food is unhygienic. User.  During COVID 19 I along with my friends went to Tirupati on 06.09.2020, On 7.09.2020 we went to The Perambur Sri Srinivasa Sweets & Snacks, for lunch. There we ordered 5 meals in total and the order number was 22942. The meal consists of rice and vathal kulambu. When lunch was served, I poured the vathal kulambu on rice and noticed a foreign object. Did you inform the supervisor or manager of the restaurant about the same?

Human: Yes, I informed the supplier, supervisor and the manager, Mr. SArangabani and even showed them the rice having a piece of wire and expressed my displeasure about the unhygienic food served. But they didn’t provide any alternative meals nor did they take any remedial measures to insure the good quality food is served to the customer.

Bot: Do you have any copy of the bill for the lunch you had at Perambur Sri Srinivasa Sweets & Snack.

Human: Yes, after having lunch the opposite party has issued the bill no 22671 which mentions the total cost of lunch was Rs. 517/-

Bot: Thank you for the information. This is a case of deficiency of service on part of the restaurant. You have few options going forward. You can go for mediation and settlement of dispute outside the court or alternatively you can directly file a consumer complaint and claim compensation for the same.

Human: I don’t want to go for mediation as I have already approached the other party to resolve the issue, but to no avail. I would like to file a complaint with the consumer forum. What is the procedure to approach the consumer forum?

Human: Unfortunately, I did not capture any photographs, but I do have a video of the incident.As for health issues, none of us experienced immediate discomfort, but the presence of a foreign object in the meal was alarming.

Bot: . Additionally, did you witness any health-related issues or discomfort due to the unhygienic food?

Human: I was fine and did not face any health issues.

Bot: Now, let's discuss the procedure for filing a consumer complaint. Consumer complaints are typically filed with the district or state consumer forum. You can file a complaint at Madurai or Tirupathi. Which place do you prefer?

Human: I would prefer to file the complaint with the consumer forum in Madurai, as that is where I reside. Additionally, how much compensation is reasonably expected from  the opposite party and what is the procedure to file a complaint.

Bot: Madurai is a reasonable choice. The compensation depends on what evidence we produce in the consumer forum, the bill amount, the distress caused to the consumer by deficiency of service are taken into consideration for calculating the compensation. In this case I think you should claim a compensation of Rs. 20000/- for the deficiency in service and causing mental agony to the complainant.

Subject: Serving of unhygienic food containing piece of iron wire, on 07.09.200 bearing order no 22942 at your restaurant.  Dear Sir/Madam, This is to bring to your kind notice the serious incident that took place at your restaurant, The Perambur Sri Srinivasa Sweets & Snacks, on 07.09.2020. I visited your restaurant on 07.09.2020 with my friends and ordered 5 meals bearing order number 22942, at table no. 17-GP. Regrettably, during the consumption of the meal, a piece of iron wire was discovered in the vathalkulambu served. Upon making this unsettling discovery, I promptly informed your supplier, supervisor, and manager, Mr. Sarangabani. Shockingly, instead of addressing the situation appropriately, your staff suggested that I discard the iron wire and continue with my meal. No alternative meals or remedial measures were offered, despite the obvious deficiency in service. This incident raises serious concerns about the safety and hygiene standards maintained at your establishment. The lack of immediate corrective action on your part not only constitutes a clear violation of consumer rights but also poses a potential threat to the well-being of your patrons. The incident has inflicted significant mental agony, pain, and suffering upon me, as evidenced by the attached video recording of the entire episode. This correspondence serves as a final attempt to amicably resolve the matter before escalating it to legal proceedings. Due to the unacceptable conduct of the staff and manager at the restaurant and serving of unhygienic food: I hereby demand the following: Compensation of 50,000, this amount includes the emotional distress caused by the inadequate steps taken by you when the issue was brought to your notice and risking my life by serving unhygienic food. You are hereby given a period of 15 days from the receipt of this notice to comply with the demands stated above. Failure to do so will leave me with no option but to initiate legal proceedings, including filing a complaint under the statutory provisions of The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, at your own risk, cost, responsibility, and consequences. This notice is issued with the expectation of a prompt and fair resolution to avoid unnecessary legal actions. I trust that you will consider this matter seriously and act accordingly. Yours sincerely, Sincerely, K.Karthikeyan, Signature

Human: Yes, Please.

Bot: Sure. Here is a draft Affidavit and Memorandum of Parties. Please print and verify the names and addresses on the memorandum of parties.
