Human: Hi Consumer Grievance Assistance Chatbot, I purchased a water purifier online last year which has been giving me trouble since day 1.

Bot: I understand, let's take this step-by-step so I can gather all the details. Could you start by providing your name, age, occupation and location details?

Human: Sure, my name is Gouni Consumer Reddy, I'm 20 years old and currently a student. I reside at House no. 16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur Mandal in Wanaparthy District.

Bot: Thank you for the introduction Mr. Gouni Consumer Reddy. Can you now explain the purchasing details as to the water purifier you had purchased?

Human: I purchased an Aquasure Delight RO+UV+MTDS water purifier made by Eureka Forbes Limited. I bought it online through Amazon India on 6th August 2020 for the amount of Rs. 8,990/-. There was a delay in installation due to Covid restrictions at that time. The installation happened only on 25th August 2020, almost 20 days after delivery. But as soon as it was installed I noticed there was some leakage happening from the purifier. I complained about this defect on the same day, 25th August 2020.

Bot: What response did you get from the company when you first complained about this leakage?

Human: I called their customer care multiple times but there was no proper response. After continuously following up for 10 days, a service technician finally came after a month and was able to fix the leakage temporarily. The issues continued. While the leakage was fixed, now the purifier started taking too much time to purify water and also started wasting a lot of water during the process. I again started calling the Eureka Forbes customer care regularly to complain. They would assure me everytime that they were sending a technician within 24 hours, but no one would turn up for weeks.After waiting for a month, the technician came and said I need to install an additional filter in the purifier, which would cost me Rs. 380 extra. I had no choice but to agree and get it installed.

Bot: . Did installing this extra filter solve all the water purifier problems?

Human: No, even after installing the additional filter, I continued to face problems frequently. I had to call them multiple times again for the same issues. Then another technician came after a month and said the RO membrane had to be replaced. There was some improvement after the membrane was changed. But after about 1 week, the purifier stopped working again. Each time it would work only for a few days and then break down again.

Bot: Very frustrating experience you have had. After all these issues, what did the company technicians finally say?

Human: Technician was of the opinion that it is better to go for replacement of the product. Based on this I asked for the refund or replacement but the company said that the water purifier can not be replaced or returned only within 30 days of purchase as per the company’s terms and conditions. After this I registered a grievance on the consumer helpline website on 15-04-2021, vide No.2679203, after 3 months, I got a mail stating that “intimated customer as per policy can not refund or replace the unit after purchase of 10 months”.

Bot: See the machine was not working since day one and there have been multiple attempts to approach the opposite party. I would also recommend you send the legal notice to the opposite party.

Human: Yes, please draft the notice and ask for the replacement of the water purifier.

Bot: I would draft the complaint and the notice. But for this I need some additional information, like the name of the parties, your name and the name and address of the opposite party. Kindly noted that we will have 2 opposite parties, Eureka Forbes Ltd and Amazon India.

Human: You can mention my address as Gouni Sai Charan Reddy, S/o Gouni Harshavardhan Reddy, aged 20 years, Occ: Student, R/o H.No.16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur mandal, Wanaparthy District.

Date:  From, IN THE MATTER OF: Mr. Gouni Sai Charan Reddy S/o Mr. Gouni Harshavardhan Reddy Aged about 20 years Occ: Student R/o H.No.16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony Atmakur Mandal, Wanaparthy District  To, The Authorized Signatory,  Eureka Forbes Ltd., Corporate Office B1/B2, 701, 7th Floor,  Marathon Innova Marathan NextGen, Off Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai - 400 013 Sub: Legal Notice for defective water purifier sold by your company  Dear Sir/Madam,  I, Gouni Sai Charan Reddy, S/o Gouni Harshavardhan Reddy, residing at H.No.16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur mandal, Wanaparthy District (hereinafter 'Consumer'), had purchased an Aquasure Delight RO+UV+MTDS water purifier on 06.08.2020 for Rs. 8,990/- from your company through Amazon website. The installation was done on 25.08.2020. From day one itself, the product had defects resulting in leakage. I raised multiple complaints but there was no proper response even after continuous follow ups. The purifier worked well for a month and again the same problem persisted. I made frequent calls to your customer care team, who assured me a technician would be sent in 24 hours. However, the technician came only after a month and recommended installation of an extra filter costing Rs.380, which I paid for. In spite of installing the extra filter, the problem continued. I raised multiple complaints but every time a new fault was identified by your technicians - first RO membrane replacement, then the starting machine is unrepairable. It is evident the water purifier had severe manufacturing defects from the beginning which could not be rectified despite repairs. This amounts to deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Despite my requests for refund/replacement, your company has denied citing the expiry of the 30 day return policy. Through this legal notice, I want to demand: Full refund of Rs. 8,990/- paid for the defective water purifier; or replacement with a properly working unit. Compensation of Rs. 20,000/- for mental harassment and agony suffered. Costs of Rs. 10,000/- incurred in pursuing this complaint. If the above demands are not met within 15 days, I will initiate appropriate legal proceedings for redressal of my grievance, without further notice. I have retained a copy of this notice as evidence.  Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Gouni Sai Charan Reddy

Human: What if you do not get any reply to the legal notice. What other remedy do I have?

Bot: You can draft a consumer complaint against both the opposite parties.

Human: Thank you for your advice. Can you draft a consumer complaint so that I can file a complaint in case I do not get a positive reply through the medium of notice?

Bot: Yes, sure. I would also like to inform you that you can file the complaint in Mumbai, Mahabubnagar and Bangalore. Which option do you prefer?

Human: I would like to file the complaint in Mahabubnagar.

Bot: I have carefully documented all the facts and timeline. I will help draft a consumer complaint so you can get a replacement or refund at the earliest. Let's proceed with filing it. Please provide information about the evidence that you have like the invoice and other proofs.
