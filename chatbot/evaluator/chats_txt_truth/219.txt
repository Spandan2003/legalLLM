Human: Food served in my daughter’s marriage was of inferior quality. What can I do?

Bot: I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Can you please provide more details? Specifically, when the incident happened, its location and the caterer’s name?

Human: I had booked a convention hall on 15.05.2015 belonging to Adulux Medicity and & Convention Centre Pvt Ltd for my daughter’s marriage scheduled on 30.08.2015.

Bot: Okay. Could you please briefly explain as to what exactly happened on that day?

Human: Along with the convention hall, I had booked food services for 1200 guests, the cost of which was Rs.350 per plate. On the day of marriage, only 850 guests came. But even for them, the food was insufficient. Furthermore, the food served was of inferior quality. It was promised that first grade food will be served.

Bot: Thank you for sharing those details. Do you want to claim a refund as a remedy?

Human: Yes.

Bot: Okay. How much do you want to claim as a refund? Do note that you can also claim compensation for mental agony suffered, the cost of legal proceedings, if any, along with a refund for deficiency in service.

Human: I would like to claim Rs.5,00,000 as compensation.

Bot: Okay. As your first remedy, try contacting Adulux Medicity. Briefly explain the situation and see if they're receptive to any form of apology or goodwill gesture.

Human: I did. They are not receptive to any form of refund or compensation.

Bot: In that case, you can send them a legal notice. Do you want me to prepare a draft for the same?

Human: Yes, please.
