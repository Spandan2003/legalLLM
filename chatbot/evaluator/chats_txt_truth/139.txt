Human: The item given for dry cleaning was misplaced. What do I do now?

Bot: Hi, thanks for reaching out to Utopia, a one-stop destination for legal advice regarding consumer grievances. To help me serve you better, could you please provide me with more details regarding the incident?

Human: On 09/12/2019, I went to a shop that provides dry-cleaning services, gave a saree, one kurta-pajama set, and one cotton shirt for dry-cleaning and the date for returning the dry-cleaned apparel was 13/12/2019. On 18/12/2019, the complainant received all the items except the saree. When enquired, I was nonchalantly informed that the item had been misplaced. Later, I was told the item got damaged during the dry-cleaning process, and that adequate compensation would be provided. However, I received only Rs 10,000 when the actual price of the product was Rs 18,000, so I refused to accept the sum of Rs 10,000 provided.

Bot: Okay. Is there anything else you would want me to know about the incident?

Human: I paid an amount of Rs 3000/- for the service. Branch visited: Jeevan Nagar

Bot: Did you raise the matter with the company?

Human: Yes, sent many emails but received no favorable response

Bot: Did you consider sending a legal notice?

Human: Yes, actually, it was only after sending a legal notice dated 22/06/2020 that the company came forward to pay a sum of Rs 10,000/- for the misplaced item.
