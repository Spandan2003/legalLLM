Human: Hi, I have a problem with my child's school fees. They are demanding fees for an entire quarter even though my child only attended for 2-3 days. The school is refusing to refund or prorate the fees for the little time my child was there.

Bot: Charging the full quarter's fees for only 2-3 days of attendance could potentially be seen as an unfair trade practice under consumer protection laws. Did you sign any agreement with the fee policy when enrolling your child initially or did the school provide proper disclosure of this quarterly fee policy before demanding payment?

Human: When I enrolled my child initially, I did sign an admission form stating the fees were non-refundable. However, that didn't specify they could charge a full quarter's fees for only 2-3 days of attendance.

Bot: Have you escalated this issue to higher authorities at the school already?

Human: I raised this issue with the school administration requesting they pro-rate the fees, but they refused.

Bot: When did the school demand that you pay the entire fee and when did you pay the fees?

Human: I applied for a leaving certificate on 8th April 2018, but the school refused until I paid the fee. I needed the leaving certificate on an urgent basis so I paid Rs. 13,200/- on 31/05/2018 upon which I got the certificate.

Bot: Okay. Are you considering mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods before taking legal action against the seller or dealership?

Human: No. I want to take it to Court.

Bot: Before you file a complaint before the forum, you would have to send a notice to the school. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, or if you do not receive a response from them at all, you can initiate legal action by approaching the consumer court. Do you want me to draft a notice for you?

Human: Yes

Bot: In that case, I would require additional details such as your full name and address, the full name and address of the school, the principal and chairman of the school.

Human: My name is Jitendra Khatri. I live in C- 103, Aries signature, Opp. Shyam Tulsi society, Diwalipura, Vadodara. The Poddar World school is situated in Anandilal and Ganesh Poddar society, Saraswati road, Santacruz (West), Mumbai 4000 12. The chairman’s address is 85, Poddar centre Charbaug post, Office, Dr B.R. Ambedkar Road, Parel, Mumbai 400 012.  The principal’s address is Bhimpura Koyai Channel Road, Sherkhi,Vadodara 391 330.

Bot: Thank you. Do you know how much compensation you would like to claim?

Human: Yes. I want a refund of the excess fees of Rs.13,200/- charged for the quarter and Rs. 1,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony.

Bot: Okay. Do you want to send the notice physically or via email? If you want to send it via email, please provide me with the email ID that can be used by the school, the principal and the chairman if they want to send a reply.

Human: I will send it physically.

Bot: Thank you. You can access the Notice. here. Please keep in mind that your signature is required in the notice.

Mr. Jitendra Khatri, C- 103, Aries signature, Opp. Shyam Tulsi society, Diwalipura, Vadodara   [Date]  The principal, Poddar World school Bhimpura Koyai Channel Road Sherkhi,Vadodara 391 330 The chairman Head office, Poddar Group of schools 85, Poddar centre Charbaug post, Office, Dr B.R. Ambedkar Road, Parel, Mumbai 400 012 The Poddar World school, Head office Poddar group of schools, Anandilal and Ganesh Poddar society, Saraswati road, Santacruz (West), Mumbai 4000 12   Subject: Complaint Regarding Unfair Trade Practices and Demand for Compensation  Dear Sir/Madam,  I am writing to formally complain about the unfair trade practice faced by me.  This is in regard to the illegal and unfair charging of fees for the full academic quarter of April-June 2018 by your school, despite my daughter Navya Khatri (Admission No. ______) attending for merely 2-3 days in April 2018 before withdrawing. As you are aware, I had submitted an application on 8th April 2018 seeking a Transfer Certificate for my daughter to join another school for personal reasons. Despite attending for only 2-3 days in April, your school insisted on collecting the full quarterly fees of Rs.13,200/- before issuing the TC.  I had repeatedly requested your school authorities to charge the fees on a pro-rata basis for the 2-3 days of attendance instead of the full quarter amount. However, my requests were unjustly denied. Left with no option, I was forced to pay the entire Rs.13,200/- under duress on 31/05/2018, after which the TC was issued. I have reported the above matter to you before but despite my pleadings, you have not made good the amount paid, which is indeed regrettable. On account of your aforesaid dereliction of duty and failure and neglect to rectify the same I have suffered losses/incurred expenses which you are liable to compensate to me.  You are hereby finally called upon to pay compensation of Rs.13,200/- charged for the quarter with interest from the date of payment along with Rs. 1,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony, and other costs incurred within 15 days of the receipt of this notice failing which I shall be constrained to initiate against you such proceedings, as are warranted by law, besides filing a complaint under the statutory provisions of The Consumer Protection Act, 2019.  Place: Vadodara Dated: _________  Sincerely, [Your Signature] Jitendra Khatri

BEFORE THE HON’BLE DISTRICT CONSUMER DISPUTE REDRESSAL COMMISSION, (MAIN) VADODARA CC.No.464/2018  IN THE MATTER OF: Mr. Jitendra Khatri, C- 103, Aries signature, Opp. Shyam Tulsi society, Diwalipura, Vadodara. ................ COMPLAINANT Vs. The principal, Poddar World school Bhimpura Koyai Channel Road Sherkhi,Vadodara 391 330 The chairman Head office, Poddar Group of schools 85, Poddar centre Charbaug post, Office, Dr B.R. Ambedkar Road, Parel, Mumbai 400 012 The Poddar World school, Head office Poddar group of schools, Anandilal and Ganesh Poddar society, Saraswati road, Santacruz (West), Mumbai 4000 12 ............. OPPOSITE PARTY  COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 35 OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH: That the Complainant is a citizen of India residing in Diwalipura, Vadodara, and the Opposite Parties abovenamed, have their head offices in Vadodara and Mumbai respectively. This complaint relates to the unfair trade practice of the opposite party faced by the complainant. The complainant's minor daughter Navya Khatri was admitted in class 6th at the Opposite Party's school in June-July 2016 and continued her studies up to class 08/03/2018. For the academic year 2018-19, Navya was re-admitted in class 08/04/2018 at the Opposite Party's school. However, due to personal reasons, after only 2-3 days of attending class 8th, the complainant decided to withdraw Navya and transfer her to another school. On 08/04/2018, the complainant submitted an application to the Opposite Party school seeking a Transfer Certificate for Navya's admission elsewhere. Despite Navya having attended only 2-3 days in the new academic quarter, the Opposite Party demanded fees for the entire quarter from April to June 2018 amounting to Rs.13,200/-. The complainant repeatedly requested the Opposite Party to waive the full quarterly fees and charge on a pro-rata basis for the 2-3 days attended. However, the Opposite Party refused to do so. Left with no option, the complainant paid the Rs.13,200/- amount under protest on 31/05/2018, only after which the Transfer Certificate was issued by the Opposite Party school. The insistence on charging full quarterly fees from the complainant for merely 2-3 days of service amounts to an unfair trade practice, deficiency in service and adopting restrictive trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The complainant has made efforts to resolve this issue by way of representations but the Opposite Party failed to provide any justification for their actions. The Complainant relies on the following evidences: Copy of notice given to opponent by complainant Copy of acknowledgement of service of notice -2 Copy of payment of Rs.13,200/- issued by opponent No. 1 Copy of transfer certificate issued by the opponent No. 1 The complainant has not filed any complaint having the same cause of action in any other forum or court. The complainant resides within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Commission. Hence this Hon'ble Commission has jurisdiction to try and entertain this complaint The total consideration amount paid in purchasing the mobile phone is less than Rs. 50 lakhs. Hence, this Hon'ble Commission has jurisdiction to entertain this complaint. The cause of action arose on 08/04/2018 which is within the limitation period prescribed under the Act. Hence, the claim in the complaint is not barred by the law of limitation. The Complainant is complying with the Court Fees Mandated under Rule 7 of the Consumer Protection (Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020. It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Commission be pleased to: Direct the Opposite Party to refund the excess fees of Rs.13,200/- charged for the quarter, along with interest from the date of payment Award compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- to the complainant for the mental harassment and Rs. 15,000/- for the cost of proceedings Grant any other relief which this Hon'ble Commission deems fit in the facts and circumstances of the case.  Dated this day of _______________  COMPLAINANT  VERIFICATION I, Jitendra Khatri, resident of Aries signature, Diwalipura, Vadodara, hereby declare that I have not misrepresented any facts nor have tried to hide any information in my above complaint.
