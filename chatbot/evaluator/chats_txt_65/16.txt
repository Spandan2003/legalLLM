Human: Hi Consumer Grievance Assistance Chatbot. I need help with filing a consumer complaint. I purchased a motor pump set for agricultural use which has now been damaged.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with filing a consumer complaint.

To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to the damage of the motor pump set? Was it due to a manufacturing defect, poor quality, or any other reason?

Human: I purchased a MARATHIN MAK 10 HP 1440 RPMTEF motor pump set for Rs. 20,750 from a dealer named Balaji Agricultural Agencies located at Secunderabad. I bought this on 23rd September 2020 for agricultural use in my fields and was under the warranty.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details.

Can you please tell me what led to the damage of the motor pump set? Was it due to any specific reason like overuse, poor maintenance, or was it a manufacturing defect?

Human: Yes, the motor pump set was under a warranty period of 1 year from the date of purchase. I have the original purchase invoice, - the invoice is numbered 45621 dated 23/09/2020.

Bot: It seems that the warranty period has expired, but you can still try to get it repaired or replaced under the Consumer Protection Act. 

Can you please tell me what exactly happened to the motor pump set? Was it damaged due to a manufacturing defect or due to some other reason?

Human: The motor pump set worked fine initially. But within a few months of purchase, it started giving some problems. It would make loud noises and eventually stopped working completely after some time. Since it was within the 1 year warranty period, I wanted to get it repaired by the dealer under warranty.

Bot: It seems like you're facing a product liability issue with the motor pump set. You've already contacted the dealer within the warranty period, but unfortunately, the product stopped working completely. 

Can you please tell me when you first approached the dealer with the issue, and what was their response?

Human: Yes, I approached the dealer and requested them to repair it under warranty. They asked me to send the motor to them and they would repair and return it. But  the motor got  damaged in transit.

Bot: It seems like the motor pump set was damaged in transit while being sent to the dealer for repair. This could be considered a case of defective product or poor handling by the dealer.

Considering the facts, it seems that the issue is related to the product's quality or the dealer's handling. You may want to consider approaching the dealer again to request a replacement or a full refund.

However, if you're not satisfied with the dealer's response, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the State Consumer Commission for further assistance.

Before proceeding, would you like me to draft a notice to the dealer regarding this issue?

Human: For transporting the motor pump set, I used a transportation company named Navata Road Transport. On 22nd January 2021, I booked the item through them and sent it to the dealer for repairs.

Bot: That's unfortunate about the motor getting damaged in transit. Since the incident occurred on January 22, 2021, it has been more than 2 years ago. Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. You may want to consider this before proceeding further. Would you like to explore any alternative options or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint?

Human: Navata Road Transport is located in Nagarkurnool, their main office address is Door No. 18-667, Bose Buildings, Kanuru, Vijayawada. I booked the item via their Nagarkurnool branch. The waybill number is SO94101-1 dated 22/01/2021. As for declared value, I specified Rs. 5,000 while booking the transportation through them.

Bot: I do not have information about Navata Road Transport's Nagarkurnool branch. I can guide you on the next steps, but you may need to contact them separately for further assistance. 

Since the motor pump set was damaged in transit, did you ask Navata Road Transport to compensate for the damage or take any action regarding this?

Human: Yes, when the motor pump reached the dealer, it was completely damaged. The base and body were bent and crushed, the terminal plate was broken, and the motor was in completely unrepairable condition. The dealer informed me that due to the extensive transit damage, they cannot accept or repair it under warranty.

Bot: It seems like the transportation company, Navata Road Transport, is responsible for the damage. Since the dealer is not willing to repair or replace the motor pump set under warranty, you may want to consider filing a complaint against them. Have you already contacted Navata Road Transport regarding the damage?

Human: I immediately contacted Navata Road Transport and questioned them about how the motor was damaged so badly during transit. But they did not give any satisfactory response regarding this. They also refused to take any responsibility for the damage.

Bot: It seems like Navata Road Transport is not taking responsibility for the damage. Since the issue occurred within the warranty period and the dealer is not willing to repair it, you may want to consider taking further action. The value of the motor pump set is around Rs. 20,750, which is above the one crore rupees limit for the District Commission. You may want to approach the State Commission or the National Commission for redressal. 

Before proceeding, I would like to inform you that the time elapsed since the incident is more than 2 years, which is the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint. You may still be able to file a complaint, but it's essential to act quickly. 

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to Navata Road Transport, or would you like to explore other options?

Human: When I called them and complained, they simply denied any liability. They insisted the motor pump was in fine condition when transported and refused to even inspect the damaged item. I got no proper response despite multiple complaints to Navata Road Transport.

Bot: It seems like Navata Road Transport is not taking responsibility for the damage. Given that the motor pump set was in warranty and was damaged during transit, I would suggest that you file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance. You can also consider approaching the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Commission for further action. Would you like me to guide you on drafting a complaint letter or notice to the dealer and Navata Road Transport?

Human: Yes, I informed the dealer Balaji Agricultural Agencies about how the motor was damaged during transit by Navata Road Transport. I requested them to address this issue and arrange for repairs under warranty as promised. However, they also refused to take any responsibility in the matter.

Bot: It seems like both Navata Road Transport and Balaji Agricultural Agencies have denied responsibility. Given that the motor pump set was under warranty and was damaged during transit, you may have a case to pursue. Since more than 2 years have passed since the incident (23rd September 2020 to the current date 26th July 2024), please note that the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years. However, I would still recommend taking further action to resolve this issue.

Would you like to consider filing a consumer complaint against Navata Road Transport and/or Balaji Agricultural Agencies?

Human: Due to the motor being damaged, I have suffered a huge loss. Firstly, I have lost the cost of the motor pump set itself, which is Rs. 20,750 that I spent to purchase it. Secondly, I have not been able to carry out agricultural activities properly without the motor pump set, leading to production losses. I estimate the production losses to be around Rs. 1 lakh.

Bot: It seems like you have incurred a significant loss due to the damaged motor pump set. Considering the warranty period has expired, you may need to take legal action to recover your losses. Have you considered filing a consumer complaint against Navata Road Transport and Balaji Agricultural Agencies?

Human: Yes please, I would like you to draft the consumer complaint on my behalf against both the transporter and dealer to seek compensation for my losses. Please include all the relevant details we discussed.

Bot: Here's a draft consumer complaint for your review:
