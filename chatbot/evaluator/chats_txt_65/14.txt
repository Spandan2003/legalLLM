Human: I have issues with my SB Account. Can you help me resolve it.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd be happy to help you with your State Bank of India (SB) account issue.

To better understand the problem, can you please tell me what specifically is causing the issue with your SB account? Is it related to transactions, account balance, account access, or something else?

Human: I've had an SB Account with the State Bank of India, Dondaparthi Branch for many years. Recently, Mr. Sharma, a Senior Associate of the bank,  advised me to open fixed deposits to receive better benefits. Trusting his advice and my faith in the bank, I handed over three cheques, each drawn for Rs. 7,00,000, to Mr. Sharma to have deposits made in the names of my three children.

Bot: It seems like you've had an issue with your SB Account at the State Bank of India, Dondaparthi Branch. 

Could you please tell me what happened after you handed over the cheques to Mr. Sharma? Did the deposits get made in the names of your children as intended?

Human: Unfortunately, I did not receive any fixed deposit certificates as expected. Despite my repeated requests and visits to Mr. Sharma, he kept postponing the issuance of the certificates, stating that they were still under process. However, I later discovered that Rs. 3441 each was being credited to my account from 28/11/2017 onwards against an annuity pension scheme, which I never agreed to or signed up for.

Bot: It seems like there's been a discrepancy with your account. Can you please tell me the date when you first noticed these unauthorized transactions and credited amounts?

Human: Yes, I approached the Branch Manager in February 2018 and informed them that I never requested or agreed to any policies. I also mentioned that even if policies were issued, I never received any documents related to them. I explained that had I been served with the documents, I would have been able to cancel the policies within the free look period.

Bot: It seems like you've been trying to address the issue with the bank since February 2018. Have you received any response or resolution from the bank regarding this matter? Also, can you please tell me the current date? (Today's date is 26th September 2024)

Human: Unfortunately, despite sending several reminders between 01/10/2019 and 24/07/2021, the opposite parties did not address my concerns or take any action. Finally, on 07/02/2020, they rejected my request to cancel the policies.

Bot: It seems like the bank has not addressed your concerns properly. You mentioned that the incidents occurred in 2017 and 2018, and the bank's response was delayed. As per the Consumer Protection Act, there is a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. Since your incident occurred more than 2 years ago, you might need to be cautious about the statute of limitations. However, I would recommend you to consult with a lawyer or the banking ombudsman to get a clear understanding of your options. 

Considering your desired relief, would you like me to draft a legal notice to the bank, or would you like to explore soft remedies first?

Human: I would like to seek a refund of Rs.21,00,000/- for the three policies and credit the same into my SB account No. 32906316511, Rs. 3,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony and Rs.20,000/- for costs

Bot: I understand that you want to seek a refund of Rs. 21,00,000, compensation for mental agony, and costs. Before we proceed, I would like to inform you that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. Since your incident dates back to 2017, it might be challenging to file a complaint now. However, I can guide you on the next steps.

Considering your situation, I would recommend sending a legal notice to the State Bank of India, Dondaparthi Branch, and Mr. Sharma, the Senior Associate, requesting them to refund the amount and provide compensation for mental agony. Would you like me to help you draft a sample legal notice?

Human: Could you provide me the helpline number

Bot: You can contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or 1915. They will be able to assist you with your grievance. Additionally, you can also file a complaint online at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/user/signup.php or through the UMANG App.

If you'd like, I can also help you draft a legal notice to send to the State Bank of India, outlining your grievances and the relief you are seeking. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: Provide me with both the Helpline Number.

Before we proceed further, let's ensure that the time limit for filing a complaint has not expired. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, has a time limit of 2 years from the date of the cause of action. In your case, the cause of action arose in 2017. Since the current year is 2024, it seems that the time limit has not expired.

To draft a complaint, we will need to prepare a Memorandum of Parties, a complaint, and an affidavit. Would you like me to assist you with drafting these documents?

Human: Yes, please.

Bot: Here's a draft of your complaint:
