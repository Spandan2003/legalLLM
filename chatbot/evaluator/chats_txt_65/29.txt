Human: Hello, I  faced a problem with my train ticket booking.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. Can you please tell me what led to the issue with your train ticket booking? Was it a problem with the ticket price, incorrect booking details, or something else?

Human: Sure. I had booked two train tickets from Madurai to Chennai for a journey on 20.08.2019. The tickets were booked on 12.08.2019 for me and another elderly, disabled person who was to travel with me. However, when we went to board the train on the day of the journey, we were denied boarding by the ticket inspector saying my name was wrongly printed on the ticket.

Bot: That's unfortunate. Can you please tell me if you have any proof of booking, such as a confirmation message or a printout of the ticket?

Human: My name is R. Jawahar, I am 70 years old and work at my shop for a living.  My address is - Mela Chinnampatti, Kalvelippatti Post, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District, PIN 625514. My mobile number is 9999xxxxxx.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the necessary details, Mr. Jawahar. 

Since the incident occurred on 20.08.2019, it has been more than 4 years. As per the Consumer Protection Act, the time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. You may still consider filing a complaint, but please be aware that it might not be admissible due to the statute of limitations.

Can you please tell me more about the ticket inspector who denied you boarding? Was it a specific person or a general behavior from the staff?

Human: Sure. His name is G. Kannan, age 61 years, Occupation: Retired Employee(Revenue Department). He is physically handicapped and needs my support to travel. His address is - D.No. 2/691, Bharathi Nagar, Kannanendal, Madurai - 625014. His mobile number is 8888yyyyyy.

Bot: I have noted down the details of both you and Mr. Kannan. Now, regarding the incident on 20.08.2019, could you please tell me if you have any proof or evidence related to the ticket booking, such as the booking reference number, ticket number, or any communication with the railway authorities regarding this issue?

Human: Yes, that is right. When we reached the station and tried to board, the ticket inspector informed me that my name was printed incorrectly as 'Sri Murugan' instead of 'R. Jawahar' on the reservation chart. My age was also wrongly mentioned as 45 years instead of 70 years. Due to this mistake in the chart, we were denied boarding on the train.

Bot: That's unfortunate. The incorrect printing of your name and age on the reservation chart caused a significant issue for you and Mr. Kannan. 

Can you please tell me when did you first notice this mistake? Was it when you received the ticket or at the station on the day of the journey?

Human: Sure, here are the details:  1. We booked the tickets on 12.08.2019 2. The booking was done at Madurai Railway station reservation counter by submitting manual requisition form 3. The PNR number was 8765091230 4. My name was printed as 'Sri Murugan' instead of 'R. Jawahar' and age was shown as 45 years instead of 70 years  I have the ticket copies and reservation form copy for proof.

Bot: I've noted down the details. Since the incident occurred on 20.08.2019, it has been more than 4 years now. Unfortunately, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. However, I would still like to guide you on the possible steps you can take.

Considering the severity of the issue and the impact it had on you and Mr. Kannan, you may want to approach the railway authorities and request them to take necessary action. You can try to contact the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) of the Southern Railway zone, where the incident occurred, and file a written complaint. The contact details for the DRM office can be found on the Indian Railways website.

Additionally, you can also use the RailMadad app or the 139 helpline number to register your complaint. They can assist you in resolving the issue and providing a suitable solution.

If you're not satisfied with the response, you can consider approaching the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Commission, depending on the value of the goods or services paid as consideration.

Would you like me to provide you with the contact details of the DRM office or the RailMadad app?

Human: We were forced to cancel our train journey and had to urgently book bus tickets to travel on that day to Chennai. This caused grave inconvenience as the bus journey was much more uncomfortable for us.

Bot: It sounds like you and Mr. Kannan faced significant inconvenience due to the error on the reservation chart. As the incident occurred on 20.08.2019, it's been over 4 years now. In consumer disputes, the time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Considering this, you might have missed the statute of limitations. However, I would still advise you to consult with a consumer court or a lawyer to discuss your options. 

Before taking any legal action, I can provide you with a draft of a possible complaint that you can use as a template. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: We suffered financial loss as we had to purchase costlier bus tickets on urgent booking. We also had to cancel our confirmed return train bookings from Chennai to Madurai scheduled for 21.08.2019, as we did not travel by train on the onward journey.

Bot: It sounds like you and Mr. Kannan faced significant inconvenience and financial loss due to the incorrect reservation chart. Given that the incident occurred on August 20, 2019, it has been over 4 years, which is beyond the 2-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint. However, considering the severity of the issue, you may still want to explore the possibility of filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the e-daakhil portal. 

If you're interested, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter or notice to the railway authorities. Would you like that assistance?

Human: Financial loss details: a) We spent approx Rs 3000 per person on urgent booking of bus tickets b) The cancelled return train tickets were of approx Rs 400 per person

Bot: That's a significant loss. Considering the facts, it seems that the railway authorities' mistake in printing your name and age on the ticket led to your inconvenience and financial loss. Since the incident occurred on 20.08.2019, and you are approaching me now, I assume it's within the 2-year time frame for filing a consumer complaint.

Would you like to proceed with filing a complaint against the railway authorities for the mistake and the resulting financial loss, or would you like to explore any other options for resolving this issue?

Human: Yes I submitted a written complaint to railway authorities (on 03.12.2019) regarding deficiency in service and mental agony caused to us. But I did not receive any response or resolution to the complaint.

Bot: It's been over 4 years since the incident, which is close to the 2-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India. However, I would still suggest that you consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline or the Railway Claims Tribunal, as you may still be eligible for compensation.

Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice to the railway authorities, or would you like to explore other options for redressal?

Human: Kindly draft the legal notice and the complaint for me.

Bot: Based on the information you provided, I will draft a sample legal notice and complaint for your reference. Please note that this is a general draft and you may need to modify it according to your specific needs and circumstances.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: PNR No. 8765091230

I am writing to bring to your notice a serious deficiency in service that I and my companion, Mr. G. Kannan, experienced while traveling from Madurai to Chennai on 20.08.2019. We had booked two confirmed tickets (PNR No. 8765091230) at the Madurai Railway Station reservation counter on 12.08.2019. However, when we reached the station to board the train, we were denied boarding due to an error in the reservation chart, which incorrectly mentioned my name as 'Sri Murugan' and age as 45 years instead of my correct name 'R. Jawahar' and age 70 years.

As a result, we were forced to cancel our train journey and purchase costlier bus tickets, which caused us a financial loss of approximately Rs. 3000 per person. We also had to cancel our confirmed return train tickets, incurring an additional loss of approximately Rs. 400 per person.

We request you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and provide us with compensation for the losses incurred. We would appreciate a response to this notice within 15 days from the date of receipt.

Subject: Deficiency in Service and Demand for Compensation

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Deficiency in Service and Demand for Compensation

This is to bring to your notice that on 20.08.2019, my son, Mr. G. Kannan (61 years, physically handicapped) and I (R. Jawahar, 70 years) had booked confirmed train tickets from Madurai to Chennai for 20.08.2019, with PNR No. 8765091230. However, when we reached the station, we were denied boarding due to incorrect details printed on the reservation chart, i.e., my name was printed as 'Sri Murugan' instead of 'R. Jawahar' and my age was shown as 45 years instead of 70 years.

Due to this deficiency in service, we were forced to cancel our train journey and purchase bus tickets at a higher cost, resulting in a financial loss of approximately Rs. 6000 (Rs. 3000 for each person). We also had to cancel our return train tickets, resulting in an additional loss of Rs. 800 (Rs. 400 for each person).

We had submitted a written complaint to the Railways on 03.12.2019, but we have not received any response or resolution to our complaint.

We hereby demand compensation for the loss suffered by us due to the deficiency in service. We request you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and provide us with a suitable compensation.

Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and inform us of the action taken in this regard.

Yours faithfully,
