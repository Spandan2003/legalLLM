Human: I am being charged an excessive amount for the electricity bill

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. Can you please tell me what led to this excessive charge on your electricity bill? Was it a sudden spike in usage or was there a change in your consumption pattern?

Human: Yes, I have a regular domestic electricity connection at my residence. But since the last 6 months, the Goa Electricity department has been issuing bills charging me at commercial rates rather than domestic.

Bot: It seems like there's a discrepancy in your electricity billing. Did you inform the Goa Electricity department about this issue, and if so, what was their response?

Human: They have excessively billed me around Rs. 2000 every month for the last 6 months by categorizing it as commercial. In total they have collected over Rs. 12,000 illegally.

Bot: That's a significant amount. When did you first notice this issue, and did you inform the Goa Electricity department about it?

Human: Yes, I have made oral complaints and written requests multiple times over the last 3 months asking them to correct the billing and refund the excess amounts.

Bot: The incident occurred 6 months ago, and you have been making complaints for the past 3 months. Please note that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since your incident is within the time frame, you still have time to file a complaint.

Would you like to take legal action against the Goa Electricity department or would you like to explore other options for a resolution?

Human: Yes I have copies of 2 written requests dated 1st December 2022 and 5th January 2023 that I had submitted to their office. But they have not responded to my complaints at all.

Bot: It's been more than 2 years since the incident occurred, which is the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India. However, since you have made efforts to complain and the issue is still unresolved, you can still take further action. 

Have you considered filing a complaint with the Karnataka Electricity Ombudsman or the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission?

Human: I prefer sending legal notice.

Bot: I can help you draft a legal notice. To draft a legal notice, we'll need some details. 

Can you please provide me with the following information:

1. Your full name and address
2. The name and address of the Goa Electricity department
3. The exact amount of excess amount charged (Rs. 12,000)
4. The dates of the written requests you sent to the department (1st December 2022 and 5th January 2023)
5. A brief description of the issue and how you would like them to resolve it (e.g., rectify the billing error, refund the excess amount, etc.)

Please provide this information, and I'll help you draft a legal notice.

Human: Sure. My details are: Balachandra Mukund Naik S/o S. Naik, aged about 47 years, residing at R/o H. No. 176, Deulwada, Harmal, Pernem, Goa. I work in the agriculture sector.

Bot: Now, I will need to draft a legal notice for you. Can you please provide the following details regarding the electricity department: their full name, address, and contact number?

Bot: To draft a legal notice, I'll need some more details about the relief you are seeking. What do you want to achieve from this legal notice - a refund of the excess amount, correction of the billing, or something else?

Human: I would want a refund of the entire amount of Rs. 12,000/- and compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for mental harassment, as well as litigation charges of Rs. 50,000/-

Bot: I will help you draft a legal notice. Here is a sample draft:
