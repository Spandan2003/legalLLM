After the surgery, Dr. Tomichan informed that during the procedure he had cut open the right leg first to see if there was any issue and then went on to operate the left leg. He assured me that he would take care of any complications arising there from. After the surgery, I started developing pain on her right leg. Though I was having difficulty in slight movement I was discharged on 29-01-2022. As the pain was not subsiding I visited the doctor on 04-04-2022. But Dr. Tomichan behaved indifferently and did not suggest anything to redress the pain and difficulties of the complainant with her right leg. Even after three months, I was unable to walk.

Kottayam.

Subject: Unauthorized Operation and Negligence of Medical Services

Dear Dr. Tomichan,

Re: Your treatment of Lalitha Mohanan (Complainant)

You are hereby put to notice that I, Lalitha Mohanan, had visited your hospital on 07-11-2021, for treatment of pain in my left leg. You advised me to undergo a surgery on my left leg, which was scheduled for 25-01-2022. During the surgery, you unauthorizedly operated on my right leg, claiming that you were checking for any underlying issues. You assured me that you would take care of any complications arising from this action.

However, after the surgery, I started experiencing severe pain in my right leg, which has persisted even after three months. Despite my follow-up visit to your hospital on 04-04-2022, you showed no concern and did not provide any adequate treatment to address my condition.

I am extremely dissatisfied with the services rendered by you and your hospital, and I hold you liable for the unauthorized operation and subsequent negligence in providing medical care. I am seeking compensation for the damages suffered by me due to your actions.

I demand that you take immediate action to rectify the situation and provide me with adequate medical treatment to address my ongoing pain and disability. I also seek compensation for the losses suffered by me, including but not limited to, medical expenses, loss of income, and pain and suffering.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response from you within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice, I shall be forced to approach the Consumer Forum for redressal of my grievances.

Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and confirm your intention to address my concerns.

Yours faithfully,

Lalitha Mohanan
