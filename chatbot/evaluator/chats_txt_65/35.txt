Human: I received a defective sofa set. What do I do now?

Bot: Sorry to hear that you received a defective sofa set.  That can be frustrating.

Can you please tell me what led to the issue with the sofa set? Was it damaged during delivery, or was it defective right out of the box?

Human: I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of ABC Furniture Private Limited located in the city of Cosmos on 04/02/2022 at 6:30 pm, and purchased a three-seater sofa.

Bot: The sofa set was defective, and you purchased it on 04/02/2022. Did the seller, ABC Furniture Private Limited, inform you about the warranty period for the product, and if so, what was it?

Human: It’s a black three-seater sofa, and the model number is AX672341.

Bot: You've mentioned that the sofa is defective. Can you please tell me what specifically is wrong with it? Is it a manufacturing defect, or is it not matching the description on the website?

Human: Rs 1,50,000/-

Bot: You purchased the sofa for Rs 1,50,000. When did you first notice the defect in the sofa?

Human: The problem was with the upholstery of the sofa which started peeling off on its own within a few days from the date of purchase.

Bot: That's concerning. You mentioned the incident occurred on 04/02/2022. Since today's date is 26/09/2024, the incident is still within the 2-year time frame, so you can still file a complaint. Have you contacted the company, ABC Furniture Private Limited, about this issue yet?

Human: 1 year

Bot: The sofa is still under warranty. Since the issue arose within the warranty period, you can contact the company to get it repaired or replaced. Have you already reached out to ABC Furniture Private Limited regarding this issue?

Human: Yes, I did, but to no avail. I called them on 10/02/2022 to voice my concerns. They said they would replace the sofa without mentioning the time period for the same, but they didn’t deliver on their promise.

Bot: It seems like the company is not responding to your concerns. You mentioned that you called them on 10/02/2022, which is after the date of purchase (04/02/2022). As of today's date (26/09/2024), it has been more than 2 years since the incident occurred. Unfortunately, under the Consumer Protection Act, a complaint must be filed within 2 years from the date of the incident. Would you like to explore other options or seek a soft remedy?

Human: Yes, they do. I did that as well on 13/02/2022, but didn’t receive any acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint. On 14/02/2022, I visited the showroom in person, and on 15/02/2022, I contacted them using their toll free number, but all efforts went in vain.

Bot: It seems like you have been trying to reach out to the company for a while now. Considering it's been over 2 years since the incident occurred (as of today's date, 26/09/2024), I would like to inform you that the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, has a time limit of 2 years for filing a complaint. You may still have some time left to file a complaint, but it's essential to act soon.

Would you like to proceed with filing a complaint with the company or consider other options, such as the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRC)?

Human: When I brought up the matter of warranty period for the product, I was informed that issues that arise due to the negligent conduct of the customer would not be covered;hence, the furniture was neither replaced, nor was the issue fixed. I also asked a number of questions about the product before making the purchase, and the seller gave a positive response to all the questions posed by me.

Bot: You've been trying to get a resolution from the company since your visit on 04/02/2022, and they've been unresponsive. Given that the issue with the sofa is within the warranty period and you've already informed them about the problem, it seems like they're trying to avoid their responsibility.

You may want to consider sending a legal notice to the company, stating the facts of the case, and demanding a replacement or refund. Would you like me to help you draft a sample legal notice?

Human: Yes, I sent them a legal notice dated 16/02/2022 seeking replacement of the sofa, and an amount of compensation to the tune of Rs 50,000/- for supplying a product of inferior quality.

Bot: It seems like you have already taken some steps to address the issue. However, since you're not satisfied with their response, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, as the value of the product is within their jurisdiction. Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a complaint to be filed with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum?

Human: I never received any response

Bot: It's been over 2 years since you sent the notice, and you still haven't received a response. Unfortunately, that means you may have missed the time limit to take further action under consumer law.

However, you can still consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the State Consumer Commission for further assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take.

Would you like me to help you draft a complaint to be filed with the State Consumer Commission?

Human: Yes, I require assistance in this regard.

Bot: I can help you draft a complaint. To begin with, I'll need to know the following details:

1. The name and address of the opposite party (ABC Furniture Private Limited, Jeevan Nagar branch)
2. The date of purchase and the model number of the product (04/02/2022, AX672341)
3. A brief description of the defect in the product (upholstery peeling off)
4. The amount of compensation you are seeking (Rs 50,000/-)
5. The relief you are seeking (replacement of the product or a refund)

Please provide me with these details, and I'll assist you in drafting a complaint.
