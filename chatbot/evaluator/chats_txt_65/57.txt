Human: I was cheated by a real estate agency.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to this situation? For instance, what exactly happened, and how were you cheated by the real estate agency?

Human: I booked flat 003 in Building 1 of their project for Rs. 26,30,495 on 17/08/2020. I paid an advance of Rs. 5,31,360 in installments. The rest was to be paid after project completion.

Bot: It seems like you've made a significant investment in the project. Can you please tell me when did you notice that you were being cheated or when did you realize that something was amiss?

Human: The agreement said they had to construct a sample flat by November 2020 for my approval. If they failed, the booking would be canceled and I would get a full refund.

Bot: That's an important clause. Did they construct the sample flat as per the agreement, and if so, was it satisfactory to you?

Human: No, they failed to construct the sample flat by November 2020. It is still not ready as of today.

Bot: The developer has failed to meet the commitment mentioned in the agreement. This is a clear breach of contract. Did the developer provide any notice or communication to you regarding the delay or the sample flat's status after November 2020?

Human: I canceled the booking on 22/04/2021 as per the terms. However, despite the cancellation, the developer has failed to refund my Rs. 5,31,360 advance payment.

Bot: That's unacceptable. You've given them the opportunity to cancel the booking, and they're not refunding your money. Did you send them a notice or a formal letter requesting the refund, or have you only communicated with them verbally?

Human: I will prefer sending filing a complaint

Bot: Filing a complaint is a good option. To proceed, I'll need some more information from you. Do you have any supporting documents, such as the agreement, payment receipts, and correspondence with the developer regarding the cancellation and refund? 

Also, have you received any communication from the developer regarding the refund or any other matter related to the case?

Human: How do I do that?

Bot: To send a legal notice, you'll need to draft a notice that includes the following details:

1. Your name and address
2. The developer's name and address
3. The details of the agreement (including the booking amount and the terms of the agreement)
4. The breach of terms by the developer (in this case, failure to construct the sample flat and failure to refund the advance payment)
5. A demand for refund of the advance payment and any other relief you're seeking

Here's a sample template you can use:
