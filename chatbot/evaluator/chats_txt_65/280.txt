Human: My Sintex tank is broken after being installed, how can I get a new one?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to the tank breaking? Was it due to any manufacturing defect, poor installation, or something else?

Human: A few months ago, on 13.04.2021.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 13.04.2021, which is more than 2 years ago, you may have a limited time frame to file a complaint. However, I would advise you to still proceed with filing a complaint to explore your options.

Could you please provide me with the contact details of the Sintex dealer or the company where you purchased the product? This will help me guide you further on the next steps to take.

Human: Om Hardwares, Ambikapur. I want to file the complaint against them.

Bot: You purchased the Sintex tank from Om Hardwares in Ambikapur a few months ago. You're looking to file a complaint against them.

Can you please tell me the approximate value of the Sintex tank and the services you paid for? This will help me guide you on the next steps.

Human: I have paid Rs. 10,500.53 for the tank, and I have the receipts from the store.

Bot: You've made a purchase of Rs. 10,500.53 from Om Hardwares in Ambikapur. Since your incident occurred on 13.04.2021, you are still within the 2-year time frame for filing a complaint. 

Have you approached Om Hardwares to report the issue with the Sintex tank yet?

Human: I was told that it was an authentic tank and would be delivered in proper condition.

Bot: It seems like there may be a case of misrepresentation or defective product. The grounds for complaint available in this case include product liability, misrepresentation, and defective equipment or merchandise. 

Before we proceed, I would like to inform you that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of purchase. Since your purchase date is 13.04.2021, you have exceeded the time limit. However, you can still try to resolve the issue amicably with the store. If not, you may consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.

Would you like me to help you draft a notice to Om Hardware, or would you like to try to resolve the issue with them directly?

Human: I went to the store but they refused to refund or replace the tank. I want to file a legal notice against them.

Bot: It seems like you've already tried to resolve the issue with the store, but they're not cooperating. Since the incident occurred on 13.04.2021, it's within the 2-year time frame for filing a complaint. I'd be happy to help you draft a legal notice. Before we proceed, would you like to know about the possible relief you can seek in the notice, such as a refund, replacement, or compensation?

Human: Yes, please!

Bot: To draft a legal notice, I'll need some more information. Can you please provide me with the details of your lawyer, including their name, bar council registration number, and address?

Human: My name is Mr. Vikas Tiwari, son of Raviprakash Tiwari, aged about 30 years, and I live near Tiwari Building, Ambikapur, Sarguja, Chhattisgarh. The store is Om Hardwares, Ambikapur, Sarguja, Chhattisgarh.
