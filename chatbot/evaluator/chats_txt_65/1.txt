Human: Hi, I have an issue with my insurance policy. How do I resolve it?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern about your insurance policy. Can you please tell me what specifically led to the issue with your insurance policy? Was it related to the premium, claim, policy terms, or something else?

Human: On Monday, in the morning hours, I loaded the paddy bags and dry paddy grass onto my vehicle and was traveling back to my village Gudivada. On the way accidentally the electric wires touched the load on the said vehicle and caught fire. Immediately I reported the matter to the Station Fire Officer, A.P. State Disaster Response and Service Department, Fire Station, Vizianagaram, but by then the said load and vehicle got completely burnt during the accident. Subsequently I reported the incident in the police station and got the FIR registered. When I claimed for the insurance the Insurance company refused it.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details of your issue with your insurance policy. 

To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the insurance company refusing your claim? Was it because of any specific reason or clause in the policy?

Human: The company mentioned that the vehicle was overloaded and the seating capacity is two, however there were three people sitting in the vehicle.

Bot: So, the Insurance company is denying the claim citing that the vehicle was overloaded. Did you inform the Insurance company about the number of people sitting in the vehicle at the time of the incident, and did you provide any evidence or witness statements to support your claim?

Human: The Estimation of repair for the Vehicle is Rs. 5,75,762. The goods lost were worth Rs.10,000.

Bot: You're claiming a total loss of Rs. 5,75,762 (vehicle repair) + Rs. 10,000 (goods) = Rs. 5,85,762.

You've already reported the incident to the police and the fire department, and you've also received a FIR. Now, you're seeking compensation from the insurance company. 

Considering the information you've provided, it seems that the insurance company has denied your claim citing overloading as the reason. However, you might want to check the policy documents to see if overloading is a covered risk or not.

Have you received any communication from the insurance company regarding this denial, and have you considered taking any further action?

Human: I would like to seek the damages caused to the vehicle i.e Rs.5,85,762/- and goods i.e Rs.10,000/- carried, Rs.3,60,000/- towards loss of earnings from the date of the accident to till date and 2,00,000/- towards Compensation

Bot: You are seeking a total relief of Rs. 11,55,762. Since the incident occurred on Monday, it is within the 2-year statute of limitations. 

Before proceeding further, I would like to inform you that you can approach the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance.

Considering your case, it seems like you may need to draft a legal notice to the insurance company. I can assist you in drafting a basic outline of the notice. Would you like me to provide you with a draft of the notice?

Human: How do I approach an Insurance Ombudsman

Bot: To approach an Insurance Ombudsman, you can follow these steps:
