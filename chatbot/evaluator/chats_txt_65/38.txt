Human: My consignment arrived late, and I was charged an exorbitant price for the delivery. What is my remedy now?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you with that.

To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the delivery and the exorbitant price charge? Was it a one-time incident or a recurring problem with the shipping company?

Human: On 08/02/2022, one Renaissance  Private Limited booked a consignment for delivery to my company. As per the receipt issued, I was supposed to receive the parcel on 10/02/2022, but I received it only on 15/02/2022. Also, I was charged Rs 1000 for it when the usual price quoted for it is less than that (Rs 800).

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details of your concern. The incident occurred on 08/02/2022, and you received the consignment on 15/02/2022. Since the incident is more than 2 years old, please note that the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. 

Given the information, it seems you have a valid case for delayed delivery and overcharging. Could you please tell me more about the company you dealt with, Renaissance Private Limited? What was the nature of the consignment, and do you have any communication or documentation from them regarding the delay or charges?

Human: Yes, I did.

Bot: You paid the amount of Rs 1000 for the consignment, which is higher than the usual price of Rs 800. Also, the consignment was delivered late, as it was supposed to be delivered on 10/02/2022 but was delivered on 15/02/2022.

Considering this, you have a valid reason to file a complaint against Renaissance Private Limited for delayed delivery and overcharging. As the incident occurred on 15/02/2022, it is within the 2-year statute of limitations.

Before we proceed, would you like to try to resolve this issue amicably with Renaissance Private Limited or would you like to file a formal complaint?

Human: Yes, this was a one-time purchase from the consignor, and was not related to our business.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 08/02/2022, it's been over 2 years, which is the statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India. I want to inform you that you may not be eligible to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 due to the time constraint. However, you can still try to resolve the issue through other means.

Would you like to try to resolve the issue with the consignor, Renaissance Private Limited, through their customer care or grievance redressal mechanism?

Human: Yes, I did not get any satisfactory reply.

Bot: You've already tried to resolve the issue with the company, but they haven't been helpful. The delay and the extra charge you were levied are clear violations of consumer rights. 

Considering the incident occurred on 15/02/2022, and today's date is 26/07/2024, the statute of limitations for filing a complaint is still valid. 

Would you like to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, as the value of the goods is less than one crore rupees?

Human: Okay. Something similar happened to another person, does that count?

Bot: I can't answer that. I can help you with consumer-related issues.

Human: I could not raise it at the time of booking as the consignor did not inform the price that was charged.

Bot: In that case, since the incident occurred on 08/02/2022, you have 2 years from that date to file a complaint. As today's date is 26/09/2024, you still have time to file a complaint. 

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a complaint or would you like to approach the company directly?

Human: Yes, I did. I brought it up on 15/02/2022, but I was told that the delay was due to unforeseen circumstances, and that prices were a matter of discretion. I also approached the customer support team, but didn't get a favorable response.

Bot: It seems like you have given them a chance to resolve the issue, but they haven't been cooperative. Since the incident occurred on 08/02/2022, it's within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. 

Would you like to consider filing a complaint with the consumer court or district consumer forum for redressal of your grievance?

Human: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 20/02/2022, but I have not received any reply from them

Bot: Since it has been more than 2 years since the incident occurred (08/02/2022), you may not be able to file a case under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. However, you can still consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for immediate assistance. 

If you're interested in pursuing a case, I can help you draft a legal notice to Renaissance Private Limited. Would you like me to provide you with a draft?

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: Before we proceed, I would like to inform you that the incident occurred on 08/02/2022, and you sent a notice on 20/02/2022. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you have 2 years from the date of the incident to file a complaint. Since more than 2 years have passed, you may not be eligible to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. However, you can still try to resolve the issue through mediation or arbitration. Would you like to know more about these options?

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you could share a template that I could use for reference

Bot: Here's a basic template for a complaint that you can use as a reference:
