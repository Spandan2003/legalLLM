Human: I have an issue with regards to Vehicle service. How do I resolve it.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd be happy to help you resolve the issue with your vehicle service.

To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what specifically went wrong with the vehicle service? Was it a fault in the service provided, a manufacturing defect, or something else?

Human: I bought a Bajaj Pulsar Vehicle with a temporary registration no. Ap31 ZKTR 6463 on 21/10/2020 for Rs.1,26,337. It was working well until the 2nd service which happened on 22/03/2021. On 27/03/2021 at Bullayya College Main Road, the display board was damaged and the vehicle stopped working and was not starting. When I called the service center, they immediately took the vehicle and on the same day returned it by making some temporary arrangements without actually resolving the issue. I could not even drive the vehicle.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details of your issue with the Bajaj Pulsar vehicle.

To better understand the situation, can you please tell me if you have approached the service center or the manufacturer, Bajaj Auto, to resolve this issue after the temporary arrangement was made on 27/03/2021?

Human: I would like to seek compensation.

Bot: To seek compensation, you need to file a complaint. Before we proceed, can you please confirm if the incident occurred within the statute of limitations? The incident occurred on 27/03/2021, and today's date is 26/09/2024. The statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years.

Human: Rs.1,26,337 with interest @ 12% p.a. and Rs. 50,000

Bot: You're claiming the original purchase price of Rs. 1,26,337 with interest at 12% p.a. and an additional Rs. 50,000 as compensation.

To proceed, can you please provide me with the contact information of the Bajaj service center or the dealership where you purchased the vehicle? This will help me guide you on the next steps to take.

Human: Yes. I have tried calling them multiple times. They never responded to my calls.

Bot: It seems like the service center is not responding to your concerns. Considering the incident occurred on 27/03/2021, it has been more than 2 years. Are you aware that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident?

Human: Could you provide me the helpline number

Bot: You can contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or 1915, available all days except national holidays, from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

Subject: Demand for Compensation for Defective Vehicle and Breach of Warranty

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Defective Bajaj Pulsar Vehicle - Ap31 ZKTR 6463

This is to bring to your notice that I, [Your Name], purchased a Bajaj Pulsar vehicle bearing the registration number Ap31 ZKTR 6463 from your dealership on 21/10/2020 for a total amount of Rs. 1,26,337. The vehicle was serviced on 22/03/2021, but on 27/03/2021, it stopped working and the display board was damaged. Despite multiple calls, your service center failed to respond or resolve the issue.

As a result, I have suffered a loss of the vehicle for an extended period, and I am seeking compensation for the same. I demand a compensation of Rs. 1,26,337 (the purchase price of the vehicle) with interest @ 12% p.a. and an additional Rs. 50,000 for the inconvenience caused.

I request you to take immediate action to settle this matter amicably and provide a suitable compensation within 30 days from the receipt of this notice.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response, I will be forced to take further action as per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

Please acknowledge receipt of this notice.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

Please note that this is a draft and may need to be customized according to your specific case. You may also want to consult a lawyer before sending the notice.

Also, please note that you can use the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Human: Can I directly file a complaint, without sending a notice.

Bot: You can directly file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission without sending a notice. However, it's recommended to send a legal notice to the service provider as a first step to give them an opportunity to rectify the issue. But if you still want to file a complaint directly, you can do so. 

Do you want me to guide you on how to file a complaint at the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

Background of the Complaint: On 21/10/2020, the Complainant purchased a Bajaj Pulsar Vehicle with temporary registration no. AP31 ZKTR 6463 from the Opposite Party. The vehicle was working well until the 2nd service, which was conducted on 22/03/2021 at the Opposite Party's service center. Subsequently, on 27/03/2021, while traveling on Bullayya College Main Road, the vehicle's display board was damaged, and the vehicle ceased to function properly. The Opposite Party was immediately contacted, and the vehicle was taken in for repairs on the same day.

Do you want me to help you file this complaint online or in person?

Human: Most of the services I have got done for the vehicle are general service such as Engine Oil exchange, chain cleaning. HEX file check, low pick up which was adjusted. The last service was for damage to the display board and the vehicle suddenly stopped working. Regarding this the service provided was not efficient. There was a temporary arrangement done to repair the display board and it was not replaced and the vehicle continued to give the same trouble even after repair.

Bot: It seems like you have a valid case against the service center. To file a complaint, you can use the e-daakhil portal or the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000). Which one would you prefer.

Human: It was mentioned that if there is any manufacturing defect then a free replacement of any of the parts is done within 5 years or 75,000 kms, whichever is earlier from the date of sale. But the service center to avoid the free replacement has never mentioned whether the damage to the vehicle or why it stopped working was a result of any manufacturing defect.

Bot: That's an important point. It seems like the service center may have tried to avoid taking responsibility for the issue. You may want to mention this in your complaint or legal notice. 

To file a complaint, you can use the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. You can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which has jurisdiction over Visakhapatnam. The address and contact details of the commission are as follows:
