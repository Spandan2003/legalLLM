Human: I have encountered an issue with a recent purchase I made, and I believe I may need legal assistance to address it.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help. To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to the problem with your recent purchase?

Human: Well, I recently purchased a KTM motorcycle from Varun Motors here in Visakhapatnam. However, when I received the receipt, I noticed that they had charged me an additional Rs. 3000 for miscellaneous expenses, which I hadn't agreed to.

Bot: That's concerning. Can you please tell me when did you purchase the motorcycle and when did you first notice this discrepancy in the receipt?

Human: Yes, I did. When I protested and refused to pay the extra amount, they threatened not to deliver the motorcycle on the same day as promised. Feeling pressured, I reluctantly paid the amount and took delivery of the vehicle.

Bot: It seems like you feel you were coerced into paying the extra amount. Did you take this issue up with Varun Motors after you received the motorcycle, or is this the first time you're reporting this incident?

Human: After taking delivery of the motorcycle, I approached Varun Motors again to request a refund of the extra amount they had charged me. They did return Rs. 2500 to me but claimed they were retaining Rs. 500 as handling charges. However, they hadn't done anything to justify these charges.

Bot: It seems like Varun Motors is not willing to fully refund the amount. Can you tell me when you approached them for the refund, approximately what date was it, and approximately how long ago was it from today's date?

Human: Yes, I issued a legal notice to them, requesting the return of the extra amount they charged me. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any response from them.

Bot: It's been more than 2 years since the incident occurred, is that correct? According to the Consumer Protection Act, you have 2 years from the date of the incident to file a complaint. Since it's been more than 2 years, you may not be able to file a new complaint. However, I can guide you on what you can do next. Would you like to pursue the matter further or consider alternative options?

Human: Could you provide me the helpline number

Bot: The National Consumer Helpline number is 1800-11-4000 or 1915. You can also reach out to the State Consumer Helpline of Andhra Pradesh, where you can find the contact number for Visakhapatnam.

Bot: Thank you for providing that information. Now, can you please tell me the date when you purchased the motorcycle from Varun Motors in Visakhapatnam?

Human: I purchased the motorcycle on August 25, 2020, and I paid Rs. 1,42,458 for it.

Bot: Please note that the Consumer Protection Act has a time limit of 2 years for filing a complaint. Since you purchased the motorcycle on August 25, 2020, you still have time to file a complaint. However, I would advise you to file the complaint as soon as possible.

Now, I'd like to help you draft a complaint. Would you like me to provide you with a draft complaint letter that you can use as a template?

Human: Yes, Varun Motors is located at D. No. 10-50-22/1, Siripuram Junction, Visakhapatnam-530003. Unfortunately, I don't have the name of their authorized signatory.

Bot: You can mention in the complaint that you're unable to obtain the name of the authorized signatory. Now, let's summarize the details we've gathered so far. You'll be filing a complaint against Varun Motors for charging an additional Rs. 3000 without your consent, and they've returned Rs. 2500 but retained Rs. 500 as handling charges. 

I can help you draft a complaint. Would you like me to draft a complaint for you?

Human: Sure. Varun Motors refunded Rs. 2500 to me on August 31, 2020, and I issued the legal notice on September 5, 2020.

Bot: I've taken note of all the details. Now, I can help you draft a complaint. However, before we proceed, I want to inform you that you have 2 years from the date of the incident to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. Since your incident occurred on August 25, 2020, you have until August 25, 2022, to file a complaint. Since today's date is 2024-09-26, you are still within the time limit.

Human: I would like to seek Rs.500/- collected towards handling charges, Rs.1,00,000/- towards compensation for the mental agony, Rs.1,00,000/- towards compensation for deficiency in service, Rs.10,000/- towards costs and any other relief which I am eligible for.

Bot: I'll draft a complaint based on the information you provided. However, please note that you should file the complaint within the statutory time limit of 2 years from the date of the incident. As the incident occurred on August 25, 2020, and you're approaching me now, it's well within the time limit.

I'll provide you with a draft complaint, and you can review and modify it as needed. If you're satisfied, we can proceed with filing the complaint through the e-daakhil portal or any other method you prefer.

Would you like me to draft the complaint now?
