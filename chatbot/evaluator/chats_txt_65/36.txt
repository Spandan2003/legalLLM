Human: The yield of the crop was much lower than the promised quantity for the seed variety purchased. What do I do now?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to this problem with the seed variety? Was it due to any specific reason such as poor quality seeds, inadequate irrigation, or any other factor?

Human: I purchased the new AX213 variety of chilli seeds from ABC Agro Private Limited on 12/04/2022, and used them in my four-acre plot of land. I was told that the yield would be around 15 quintals, but I got only 8 quintals (Harvest time period: 12/08/2022 â€“ 30/08/2022)

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. It seems like you have a legitimate concern about the quality of the seeds. 

Can you please confirm if you have contacted the company, ABC Agro Private Limited, about this issue already? If not, have you received any communication from them regarding this matter?

Human: I bought 10 packets of chilli seeds each weighing 250 grams, and the cost price of each of the packets was Rs 3500/-

Bot: That's helpful information. Did you contact the company, ABC Agro Private Limited, after you noticed the lower yield, and if so, what was their response?

Human: Yes, I did.

Bot: It seems like there might be an issue with the quality of the seeds. Did you approach the company, ABC Agro Private Limited, about this issue and their response?

Human: No, there was no mention of anything regarding that. It was an oral promise given by the seller with respect to the yield.

Bot: The oral promise regarding the yield may not be considered a valid warranty. However, since you were promised a specific yield, you can still approach the company for a refund or compensation for the loss incurred.

You purchased the seeds on 12/04/2022. Since today's date is 26/09/2024, your issue is well within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint.

Would you like to draft a complaint letter to the company or take some other course of action?

Human: Okay.

Bot: Considering that you have already harvested the crop, you may want to consider approaching the seller with your concerns. You can send them a notice requesting a refund or replacement for the difference in yield. If you'd like, I can help you draft a sample notice. Would you like me to do that?

Human: Yes, I first approached them on 10/06/2022 with respect to compensation for the loss incurred in respect of the final output I also sent reminder emails on 12/06/2022 and 14/06/2022,but to no avail.

Bot: It seems like you have already taken the first step in trying to resolve the issue with the seller. Since it has been more than 2 years since the incident occurred (12/04/2022), please note that the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years. However, you can still try to resolve the issue amicably with the seller.

Have you considered filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or using the e-daakhil portal for further assistance?

Human: Rs 1,60, 000. Rs 40,000 per acre

Bot: You're seeking compensation of Rs 40,000 per acre for the loss incurred. Since you have 4 acres, that's a total of Rs 1,60,000. You've already sent reminders, but the seller hasn't responded. Would you like to pursue legal action or would you like to explore other options to resolve this dispute?

Human: They denied responsibility for the loss

Bot: The incident occurred on 12/04/2022, which is more than 2 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the time limit to file a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since it's past the 2-year mark, you might not be eligible to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. However, you can try approaching the company again and ask them to resolve the issue amicably. If they refuse, you may consider filing a complaint under the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, if they have jurisdiction over the matter.

Would you like me to help you draft a letter to the company, or would you like to know more about the process of filing a complaint?

Human: No, I was not aware of the legal provisions in this regard

Bot: Considering the incident occurred on 12/04/2022, and you approached them on 10/06/2022, the time limit for filing a complaint has almost expired. You have about 2 years from the date of incident to file a complaint. Please note that the time limit is 2 years from the date of incident. You might still be eligible to file a complaint, but it's essential to act quickly.

Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a complaint or a legal notice to the company?

Human: Yes, I called the horticultural officer and the report submitted by him stated that there was an inherent defect in the seeds purchased which resulted in the lower yield per crop.

Bot: That's a crucial piece of information. Considering this, you may want to consider filing a consumer complaint against ABC Agro Private Limited. I can guide you through the process of drafting a complaint. Would you like me to provide you with a sample draft of a complaint letter or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the e-daakhil portal?

Human: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 16/06/2022, but I have not received any reply from them

Bot: The notice was sent more than 2 years ago, which is beyond the statutory time limit for filing a consumer complaint. However, we can still consider other options. Did you want to explore the possibility of filing a consumer complaint against ABC Agro Private Limited?

Human: Yes, I would like to

Bot: I can help you draft a complaint. To proceed, I'll need to know what relief you are seeking from the opposite party. Are you looking to get a refund of Rs 1,60,000, compensation for the loss, or something else?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I don't have information on the city of Cosmos. Could you please provide me with the name of the state or district where you reside? That way, I can guide you on the correct forum to file your complaint.

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you share a template that I could use for reference

Bot: I can provide you with a template for a complaint that you can use as a reference. Here's a sample complaint that you can use:
