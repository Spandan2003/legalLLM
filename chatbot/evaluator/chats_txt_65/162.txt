Human: Hello, I am the proprietor of Sharma Superstore and I am from Moga, Punjab. I purchased an AC from Home Solutions for my shop. The AC, since the first day, has not been cooling properly. I informed the customer care service and they told me that the AC did not have gas. After getting the AC filled with gas the problems have continued and Home Solutions has not sent a technician despite telling me that they will. What do I do?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern, Mr. Sharma. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance. 

To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the AC not cooling properly from the first day? Was it a faulty AC or was it installed incorrectly?

Human: I bought the AC on 13th August 2021. It is an IFB AC that is 1.5 tons. It cost me 36,000 Rs. On 22nd April 2022.

Bot: You purchased the IFB 1.5-ton AC on 13th August 2021, and the issue started from the first day. You have already contacted the customer care service and they mentioned that the AC didn't have gas. However, after refilling the gas, the issue still persists.

The incident occurred on 22nd April 2022, which is within the 2-year time frame from the purchase date. Can you please tell me more about the last interaction you had with Home Solutions regarding this issue? Did they provide you with any timeline for sending a technician to resolve the issue?

Human: I was told by the technicians that there was no gas. After filling the AC with gas, it worked for a while and then started causing issues again. The last time the technicians came, they told me that the AC had a microleakage problem.

Bot: It seems like the issue persists even after the gas refill. The technician's statement about microleakage suggests a possible manufacturing defect or a faulty installation. Given that the issue started soon after purchase, it's possible that the problem lies with the product or the installation.

As the incident occurred on 22nd April 2022, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is about to expire since it has been more than 2 years. However, you can still consider approaching the consumer court or the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum in Moga, Punjab. 

Have you considered approaching Home Solutions for a replacement or a refund for the defective product?

Human: Yes, they said that they would get it fixed. They have not sent anyone since then. I have made a customer care complaint and that has been of no use.

Bot: It seems like Home Solutions has not taken adequate action to rectify the issue despite your repeated complaints. The fact that it's been over a year since you purchased the AC and it still hasn't been properly fixed is concerning.

As you have already made a customer care complaint, I would suggest that you consider taking further action. Have you thought about filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or using the e-daakhil portal for a more formal resolution?

Human: I made it to both Home Solutions and IFB and I also have their acknowledgement of the same.

Bot: Since it's been more than 2 years since you purchased the AC and the issue persists, please note that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of purchase or from the date of the incident. However, considering your case, I would recommend that you still pursue the matter as it's a clear case of a defective product and the service provider's failure to rectify the issue.

Considering the lack of response from Home Solutions and IFB, I would suggest that you file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for immediate assistance. You may also consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Moga, Punjab, as the value of the AC is below 1 crore rupees.

Before proceeding, I would like to draft a legal notice to Home Solutions and IFB on your behalf. Would you like me to do that?

Human: Yes, I have contacted them several times but they have not responded.

Bot: It seems like Home Solutions has not taken adequate steps to resolve the issue despite your repeated requests. As the incident occurred on 22nd April 2022, it has been more than 2 years. However, since you've only just now come to me, I will consider it as a recent issue.

Considering the issue is still not resolved and you're not satisfied with the response from Home Solutions and IFB, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for immediate assistance.

Additionally, you can also approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Moga, Punjab, as the value of the goods (Rs. 36,000) does not exceed one crore rupees.

Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice to Home Solutions and IFB?

Human: I want a replacement along with compensation for mental agony and litigation expenses. For mental agony, I think 50,000 Rs. is reasonable.

Bot: You are seeking a replacement for the defective Air Conditioner, compensation for mental agony, and compensation for litigation expenses. The amount you mentioned for mental agony is reasonable.

Considering the cost of the AC is 36,000 Rs, and you are also seeking compensation for mental agony and litigation expenses, I would recommend that you draft a legal notice to Home Solutions and IFB Industries. This notice should clearly state the issues you have faced, the amount you are seeking as compensation, and give them a time limit to respond and rectify the situation.

I can help you draft this notice. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: What will happen if I call the state consumer helpline?

Bot: If you call the state consumer helpline, they will guide you through the process of filing a complaint and assist you in drafting the complaint. They will also provide you with the necessary information about the Consumer Forum and the process of filing a case. They may also help in mediating the dispute between you and Home Solutions and IFB.

Human: What about mediation?

Bot: Mediation is a process where a neutral third party helps you and Home Solutions to reach a mutually acceptable settlement. If you opt for mediation, the consumer forum will refer your case to a mediator. The mediator will facilitate a discussion between you and Home Solutions to resolve your dispute. If you reach an agreement, it will be recorded in writing and will be binding on both parties. If mediation is not successful, the consumer forum will proceed to hear your case.

Human: If there is no guarantee, then I want to file a complaint before the Consumer Forum.

Bot: Before filing a complaint before the Consumer Forum, I can help you draft a legal notice to Home Solutions and IFB. This notice will detail the particulars of your complaint, the relief you are seeking, and a time period for them to comply. If they do not respond or comply, you can then file a complaint before the Consumer Forum. Would you like me to help you draft the legal notice?

Human: Yes, it will be nice if you can draft a notice.

Bot: Here's a draft of the notice:
