Human: Hello Consumer Grievance Assistance Chatbot. I purchased some silver jewellery from a shop recently but I faced some issues regarding deduction of weight and purity of the products. I want to file a consumer complaint in the consumer court but need help understanding the process.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with the process of filing a consumer complaint.

To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to the deduction of weight and purity of the products? Was it due to any discrepancy in the product description, billing, or any other reason?

Human: I purchased 2 pairs of silver leg chains and 2 pairs of silver metti tags on 1st January 2022 from Lalitha Jewellery Mart in Madurai. The total bill amount was Rs. 11,013.

Bot: You purchased the silver jewellery on 1st January 2022 from Lalitha Jewellery Mart in Madurai. That's a good start. Now, can you please tell me about the issue you faced regarding the weight and purity of the products? What exactly was deducted and how did you find out about it?

Human: I did part payment in cash and part by exchange of my old silver chain.

Bot: So, you made a part payment in cash and part payment by exchanging your old silver chain. 

Now, let's talk about the issue with the purchase. You mentioned that you faced issues with the weight and purity of the products. Can you please tell me more about it? What exactly was the problem you faced?

Human: My name is V. Ramaraj, age 48 years, residing at Pasumpon Nagar, Madurai.

Bot: Thank you for providing that information, Mr. Ramaraj. Now, regarding the issue with the silver jewellery, you mentioned that there were problems with the weight and purity of the products. Can you please tell me more about what happened? What exactly did you find out about the weight and purity that made you suspect something was wrong?

Human: The old silver chain weighed approximately 201 grams which I had purchased from the same Lalitha Jewellery shop about 1 year back.

Bot: That's helpful information. Now, I'd like to clarify, what are the issues you're facing regarding the silver leg chains and metti tags you purchased on 1st Jan 2022? Is it related to the weight deduction, purity, or something else?

Human: As per standard market practice, while exchanging old silver items, shops deduct some weight for wastage and pay as per latest market rate for remaining net weight. In my case, when valuing the 201 grams old silver chain for exchange, the shop should have deducted 4 grams for dust wastage which is reasonable. But apart from 4 grams they also deducted 59 grams over and above this claiming it as processing wastage charges. So they calculated the exchange value only for the remaining 138 grams instead of at least 197 grams (201 grams - 4 grams dust charges). This 59 grams deduction was very unreasonable and resulted in financial loss to me.

Bot: So the issue is that the shop deducted an excessive amount for processing wastage charges, which you believe is unreasonable. This resulted in a lower exchange value for your old silver chain, causing a financial loss to you. That's a clear case of unfair trade practice.

Now, I'd like to know, did you bring this issue to the attention of the shop owner or manager at the time of exchange, or is this a complaint you're raising now?

Human: Yes, absolutely! As a consumer, I felt cheated. The silver jewellery that is 201 grams was brought from the same shop and I paid for the full 201 grams so when I exchanged it I should have got an appropriate return on the exchanged silver.

Bot: You're saying that the shop deducted an excessive amount of wastage, which is not acceptable to you. Did you bring this issue to the attention of the shop owner or staff during or after the exchange, and if so, what was their response?

Human: I also have another issue related to the same transaction.

Bot: You'd like to report another issue related to the same transaction with Lalitha Jewellery Mart. Please go ahead and share the details.

Human: Yes, another problem I faced was that the 190 grams new silver leg chain I purchased as part of this purchase broke in just a few days! It looks like the new silver chain given to me was made of impure silver.

Bot: That's another issue to consider. So, the new silver leg chain you purchased broke shortly after use, and you suspect it may be made of impure silver. Did you report this issue to the shop immediately after the breakage, or was it some time later?

Human: kindly draft legal notice and the complaint.

Bot: Based on your issues, I can draft a legal notice and a complaint for you. However, please note that this is a basic draft and it's recommended to consult a lawyer before finalizing and sending the notice or filing the complaint.
