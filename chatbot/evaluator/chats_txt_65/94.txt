Human: Hello, I recently had a very unpleasant experience while travelling on an international flight and lost my luggage. The airline has failed to find or compensate me for it even after months of followup. I want to file a consumer complaint in the consumer court against the airline but need help drafting it. Can you guide me through the process?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with the process of filing a consumer complaint against the airline.

To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the loss of your luggage? Was it a delay in baggage handling, or did you notice any signs of damage or tampering during the flight?

Human: My name is A. Sivanupandian,

Bot: Thank you, Mr. Sivanupandian. Now, could you please tell me what led to the loss of your luggage? Was it due to the airline's negligence, or was it misplaced during transit, or something else?

Human: Arumugam

Bot: Could you please tell me the date of the incident when you lost your luggage? This will help me determine if the complaint can be filed within the statutory time limit of 2 years.

Human: Age: 35 What is your occupation? Occupation: Teacher What is your address? I reside at D.No.136, North Street, Sinkikulam, Nanguneri Taluk, Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu.

Bot: Thank you for providing the necessary details. 

Now, let's focus on the airline issue. You mentioned that the airline failed to find or compensate you for your lost luggage. Can you please tell me more about what happened? What was the date of your flight, and when did you first report the loss of your luggage to the airline?

Human: I travelled from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Madurai, India on 15th August 2017 on Srilankan Airlines flight UL139. My ticket details are E-ticket no. 6034996832446, Seat no. 29E.

Bot: The incident occurred on August 15th, 2017. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since the incident happened in 2017, it's been over 6 years. I want to caution you that you might not be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. However, you can still try to file a complaint under other applicable laws or seek assistance from the airline's customer service.

If you still want to proceed, could you please provide the details of the airline's customer service interactions you've had so far? What were the names of the representatives you spoke to, and what were their contact numbers?

Human: I had checked in one bag weighing around 8kgs during departure at Colombo airport. It contained clothes, dry fruits, chocolates, dry fish, honey and other food items that I had purchased as gifts for family and friends during my Sri Lanka tour. The total value of the contents would be around Rs. 2 lakhs. When I arrived at Madurai airport after landing, I waited at the belt for over 2 hours, but my bag never came. That's when I understood it was lost.

Bot: The incident occurred on August 15, 2017, which is more than 2 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you have a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. Since this incident occurred before the Act came into effect, you may still be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. However, please note that the airline may argue that the statute of limitations has expired.

Considering the value of the contents in your bag, it's a substantial loss. You should have claimed compensation for the lost items from the airline immediately after the incident.

Let's move forward with drafting the complaint. I can help you with a draft notice to the airline. Would you like to proceed with filing a complaint and seeking compensation for the lost luggage and its contents?

Human: Yes, I immediately informed the airport authorities and also the Srilankan Airlines staff about my missing bag. They said they would search but could not find it. The airline staff gave me a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) to list the contents of my lost bag and record the incident.

Bot: You have taken the first step by reporting the incident and getting a PIR. Since the incident occurred on August 15, 2017, and it's now 2024, please note that the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 has a 2-year time limit for filing a complaint. Considering this, you might be a bit late to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. However, you can still approach the airline's customer service or their headquarters to see if they can assist you in resolving the issue.

Considering the compensation for lost luggage, Srilankan Airlines is supposed to compensate you for the contents of your bag. Did you receive any compensation from the airline for your lost luggage?

Human: I sent multiple emails on 17th Aug, 18th Aug and 20th Sept 2017 to follow up on my missing bag but the airline did not give any proper response.

Bot: It seems like the airline didn't respond properly to your follow-ups. Did you also try contacting them over the phone or in person, or just through email? Also, did you make any attempts to escalate the issue to a higher authority or a consumer court?

Human: The airline office is located at Madurai Airport itself. I had booked the flight tickets directly via their website around 1 month before travel in July 2017.

Bot: Since you booked directly with the airline, their office at the Madurai airport would be the best point of contact. However, I don't have the exact address of the Madurai airport office. You may want to check the airline's website or contact them again to get the exact address.

Let's focus on drafting the complaint now. I'll guide you through the process. Would you like me to draft a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, or do you want to approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum?

Human: Kindly draft a legal notice.

Bot: Here's a draft legal notice you can use as a starting point:

**NOTICE OF DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION FOR LOST LUGGAGE**

To,

Sri Lankan Airlines
Madurai Airport, Madurai, Tamil Nadu

Subject: Demand for Compensation for Lost Luggage (E-ticket no. 6034996832446, Flight UL139, Date of Travel: 15th August 2017)

Respected Sir/Madam,

Re: Loss of Luggage (8 kgs) during travel from Colombo to Madurai on 15th August 2017

I, A. Sivanupandian, a resident of D.No.136, North Street, Sinkikulam, Nanguneri Taluk, Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu, hereby serve this notice to you, Sri Lankan Airlines, in respect of the loss of my luggage during my travel from Colombo to Madurai on 15th August 2017.

I had checked in one bag weighing around 8 kgs at Colombo airport, which contained clothes, dry fruits, chocolates, dry fish, honey and other food items worth approximately Rs. 2 lakhs. Unfortunately, the bag did not arrive at the Madurai airport despite my waiting for over 2 hours after landing.

I immediately informed the airport authorities and the airline staff about the missing bag and was given a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) to record the incident. Despite my follow-up emails on 17th August, 18th August and 20th September 2017, I have not received any response or compensation from the airline.

I hereby demand compensation for the loss of my luggage, including the value of the items contained therein, as per the applicable regulations and the Montreal Convention. I also request you to provide me with a written acknowledgement of this notice and a confirmation of the steps you will take to resolve this matter.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response from you within 30 days from the date of this notice, I will be forced to initiate legal proceedings against you to recover the compensation due to me.

Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and confirm the steps you will take to resolve this matter.

Yours faithfully,

A. Sivanupandian

Dated: [Current Date]

Please note that this is just a draft and you may need to modify it as per your specific requirements and circumstances. Also, please ensure that you send the notice by registered post with acknowledgement due and keep a record of the same.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Human: What if I donâ€™t get any reply for this notice? What remedy do I have?

Bot: If you don't receive a response from the airline after sending the legal notice, you can consider the following steps:

1.  File a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF): As the value of the lost baggage is less than one crore rupees, you can approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Tirunelveli. You can file a complaint against Srilankan Airlines, stating the facts of the case, and seeking compensation for the lost baggage and mental agony.
2.  File a complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDR): If you are not satisfied with the decision of the DCDRF, you can appeal to the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDR) in Tamil Nadu. The SCDRC has jurisdiction over cases where the value of the goods or services is more than one crore rupees but less than ten crores.
3.  File a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC): If the value of the lost baggage is more than ten crores, you can approach the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in New Delhi. The NCDRC has jurisdiction over cases where the value of the goods or services is more than ten crores.
4.  File a complaint with the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA): The CCPA is a central authority that deals with consumer grievances and complaints. You can file a complaint with the CCPA if you feel that Srilankan Airlines has engaged in unfair trade practices or has violated any consumer protection laws.

Before filing a complaint, ensure that you have all the necessary documents, including the PIR, email correspondence, and other relevant evidence. You can also seek the help of a consumer activist or a lawyer to guide you through the process.

Additionally, you can also approach the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000 or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can provide you with guidance and support in filing a complaint and navigating the consumer grievance redressal process.

Human: Yes, draft a complaint  for me.

Bot: Here is the complaint that you can file.
