Human: Hi. I have grievances related to injuries and losses suffered by my minor daughter due to an electrical accident at her school. I need help understanding the process and drafting the complaint. Can you guide me?

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear that your daughter suffered an injury due to an electrical accident at her school. I'm here to help you with the process and drafting the complaint.

To start, could you please provide more information about the incident? What led to the accident? Was it due to faulty wiring, a malfunctioning electrical appliance, or something else?

Human: Sure. My name is Marri Jagga Rao, my age is 38 years and I reside at Bijjapalli, Kamayyapeta Village, Hukumpeta Mandal, Visakhapatnam. I am an employee at SBI Bank, Hukumpeta Branch. My daughter's name is Marri Roja Rani. She is 13 years old and studies at the Government School in our village, she resides in the same place as I live.

Bot: Thank you for sharing this information, Mr. Rao. I'm sorry to hear about the incident involving your daughter.

To proceed, can you please tell me more about the electrical accident at the school? What happened, and when did it occur? Was it a recent incident, or did it happen some time ago?

Human: On 16th July 2018 around 9:30 am, my daughter Roja Rani and her friend were playing in the balcony on the 1st floor of their school building. They accidentally touched some high tension wires passing very close to the parapet and got electrocuted. Both girls fell down from the height. While my daughter sustained grievous burn injuries, her friend unfortunately died on the spot.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear about the tragic incident. Given that the incident occurred on 16th July 2018, it's been over 6 years, which is close to the 2-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India. However, since you're approaching me now, I assume you're still interested in seeking redressal. 

Could you please provide more information about the school administration's response after the incident? Did they take any action or provide any compensation to your daughter or your family?

Human: She was first taken to the Area Hospital in Hukumpeta for first aid. From there she was shifted to K.G Hospital in Vizag on the same day where doctors had to amputate her left leg toes namely, leg great toe, 2nd and 3rd toe and right hand below elbow. The total medical expenses for treatment and medicines was around Rs. 5 lakhs.

Bot: I'm deeply sorry to hear about the severity of your daughter's injuries, Mr. Rao. It's been over 6 years since the incident occurred, and you're now approaching me for assistance. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you have a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. Since the incident occurred on July 16, 2018, you've exceeded the time limit. However, I can still guide you on the process, but it might not be feasible to pursue a case at this stage.

Considering the severity of the incident, I would recommend filing a police complaint and a civil case in the court. However, since the time limit has passed, it might be challenging to get any relief under the Consumer Protection Act. If you're interested in pursuing a case, I can help you draft a complaint, but please note that the chances of success might be limited.

Would you like to explore other options, such as filing a police complaint or a civil case, or would you like to proceed with drafting a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, despite the time limit?

Human: I believe Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL) is responsible as the high tension wires were passing too close to a school balcony, endangering students' lives. The Chairman, Managing Director, Superintending Engineer and Assistant Engineer of the Vizag division should be made opposite parties.

Bot: Based on the information you've provided, it seems that the incident occurred on July 16, 2018, which is more than 6 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Unfortunately, this means that you may not be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 for this incident.

However, I would advise you to consult with a lawyer to explore other legal options, such as filing a case under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or other relevant laws. Additionally, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) or the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which had a longer statute of limitations.

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, or would you like to explore other legal options?

Human: Yes. The Hukumpeta Police registered the incident as a case in Crime No.37/2018.

Bot: So, you have already filed a police complaint. Now, regarding the consumer grievance, I would advise you to file a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (CDRF) or the District Consumer Forum, as the value of the damages (Rs. 5 lakhs) falls within their jurisdiction. 

Before we proceed with drafting the complaint, I would like to remind you that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since the incident occurred on 16th July 2018, you have already filed a complaint within the time frame.

Would you like to proceed with drafting a complaint to be filed with the CDRF or District Consumer Forum?

Human: I issued a legal notice on 21st February 2022 requiring them to pay compensation of Rs. 15 lakhs. But they did not respond even after receiving it.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on July 16, 2018, and you issued a legal notice on February 21, 2022, it seems that you are still within the time limit for filing a consumer complaint. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, allows for a time limit of 2 years from the date of the cause of action.

Considering this, would you like to file a consumer complaint against APEPDCL for compensation for your daughter's injuries and the medical expenses incurred?

Human: Yes. But Iâ€™m not sure how much to claim.

Bot: You've already incurred medical expenses of Rs. 5 lakhs. You may also claim the cost of the notice, any other expenses incurred, and possibly compensation for your daughter's pain and suffering. We'll consider all these factors while drafting the complaint.

Considering the incident occurred on 16th July 2018 and you issued a notice on 21st February 2022, we have some time left to file a complaint. However, I would like to remind you that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, has a time limit of 2 years from the date of the cause of action, which in this case is the incident date. We should proceed with caution to ensure we meet this deadline.

Would you like to draft a complaint to the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum or would you like to explore other options like a police complaint or a civil lawsuit?

Human: Could you provide me the helpline number

Bot: The National Consumer Helpline (NCH) number is 1800-11-4000. You can also download the UMANG App or NCH App on your mobile phone to register your grievance. Additionally, you can visit the website https://consumerhelpline.gov.in to register your complaint online. If you'd like, I can also provide you with the state-specific consumer helpline number for Andhra Pradesh.

Human: Provide me with both the Helpline Number.

Bot: You can call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or 1915. For the state of Andhra Pradesh, you can contact the State Consumer Helpline at 1800-180-2229.

Human: Andhra Pradesh

Bot: For Andhra Pradesh, the State Consumer Helpline Number is 1800-180-2229. The National Consumer Helpline Number is 1800-11-4000. You can contact them for immediate assistance with your grievance.

Human: How do I proceed, if I have to file a complaint.

Bot: To file a complaint, you can follow these steps:

1.  You can file a complaint in person or through an agent at the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
2.  You can also send a complaint by registered post along with the required court fee.
3.  Complaints can be filed online at the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/.

Attach an affidavit signed and verified by you and all other relevant documents, such as bill details, mode of payment, and guarantee or warranty cards.

Before proceeding, please note that you may need to pay a fee for filing the complaint, which varies based on the value of goods or services paid as consideration. I can provide you with the details of the fee structure if you need it.

Human: The Chairman and Managing Director, The Superintending Engineer (Operations), The Assistant Engineer (Operations) APEPDCL, Opp Hotel Green Park, Visakhapatnam

Bot: To file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, you will need to draft a complaint. I can guide you in drafting it. Here's a general outline of what the complaint should contain:

1.  Your personal details (name, age, address, occupation)
