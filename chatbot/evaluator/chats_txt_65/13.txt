Human: I want to file a complaint against the hospital for their poor services. Guide me

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. To help you better, can you please tell me what led to this issue with the hospital's services? Was it a specific incident or a recurring problem?

Human: On May 6, 2019, I was involved in a serious auto accident where a lorry collided with the auto I was traveling in. As a result, I sustained multiple injuries, including a post-operative fracture to my left femur. I was immediately transported to Usha Prime Multi Speciality Hospital for treatment.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear about your accident and injuries. It sounds like a traumatic experience.

Can you please tell me more about the issue you faced with the Usha Prime Multi Speciality Hospital's services? Was there a breach of duty by the doctor, wrong treatment, or any other issue that led to your dissatisfaction?

Human: I underwent several medical procedures and treatments at the hospital, incurring medical expenses totaling Rs. 79,000. However, I believe there were deficiencies in the services provided by the hospital and the attending consultant, Dr. K. Raja Sagar.

Bot: It seems like there might be a potential case of medical negligence or deficiency in service. Did you get the consent of Dr. K. Raja Sagar before undergoing the medical procedures, and do you have any evidence or documentation of the treatment and expenses incurred?

Human: Yes, despite the severity of my injuries, the hospital issued a wound certificate indicating that my injuries were "simple in nature" rather than "grievous." This discrepancy in the documentation could have significant implications for any legal proceedings related to the accident.

Bot: That's a serious concern. Did you inform the hospital or Dr. K. Raja Sagar about this discrepancy at the time, or was it only later that you realized this issue?

Human: Yes, I issued a legal notice to both the hospital and Dr. Raja Sagar on July 23, 2019, outlining my concerns and requesting appropriate action. Unfortunately, they responded with a notice of their own on July 30, 2019, without addressing the issues raised in my notice.

Bot: It seems like you have already taken some steps to address the issue. However, since you're not satisfied with their response, you may want to consider filing a formal complaint with the relevant authorities.

As you mentioned that the incident occurred on May 6, 2019, it's within the 2-year statute of limitations. Would you like to pursue legal action or explore other options for resolving this matter?

Human: Yes, I have copies of all the correspondence, including the legal notices and medical records.

Bot: Given that more than 2 years have passed since the incident (the incident occurred on May 6, 2019), please note that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years. You may still be able to file a complaint, but you should be aware of this limitation.

Considering your situation, it seems that you have already taken initial steps by issuing a legal notice to the hospital and Dr. Raja Sagar. If you're interested in pursuing further action, I can guide you through the process of drafting a complaint to be filed with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum.

Would you like me to assist you in drafting a complaint?

Human: I would like to seek a compensation of Rs.18,00,000 with an interest @ 9 % p.a. And Rs.30,000 for the mental agony and Rs.10,000 for the costs.

Bot: Considering the incident occurred on May 6, 2019, and it's now 2024, you are still within the 2-year time limit to file a complaint. 

As you have already issued a legal notice to the hospital and Dr. Raja Sagar, the next step would be to file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum. 

Before proceeding with filing a complaint, I can help you draft a draft legal notice to the hospital and Dr. Raja Sagar, outlining your grievances and demands for compensation. Would you like me to assist you with that?
