Human: I have been cheated by a real estate developer agency, they have not allotted me a house even after the payment.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue with the real estate developer agency? Was it a delay in handing over possession, or was there some other problem?

Human: Yes, in April 2019, representatives of Aditya Builders & Developers promised to book a 83.5 sqm flat for me in their Perry's Arcade project, but they have not executed the sale deed despite full payment.

Bot: It seems like a serious issue. The fact that you made the payment in full and still haven't received the possession of the flat is a clear breach of contract. 

You mentioned the incident occurred in April 2019. Since today's date is September 26, 2024, the incident is more than 5 years old, which may be close to the statute of limitations. However, it's best to consult a lawyer to confirm the exact timeline and proceed accordingly.

Can you please tell me more about the representatives of Aditya Builders & Developers? Do you have any contact information or any communication from them regarding this issue?

Human: Yes, I have the email conversations and brochure copy with project details. As discussed, I signed the booking agreement on 10.04.2019 and transferred the full amount Rs. 7,34,800 to their HDFC bank account ****1234 via RTGS on 25.04.2019.

Bot: The incident occurred in April 2019, which is within the 2-year time limit for filing a complaint. However, I would like to remind you that the time limit for filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act is 2 years from the date of the cause of action, which in this case is the date of payment, 25.04.2019. So, you had until 25.04.2021 to file the complaint. Since you're filing now, I would advise you to file an application for condonation of delay, which I can guide you on.

Can you please provide me with the contact details of Aditya Builders & Developers, including their address and contact numbers?

Human: Yes I have the agreement and payment receipt ready. But despite repeated requests, they have not executed the sale deed in my favor yet.

Bot: It's been over 5 years since the incident occurred in 2019. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you have a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. However, you can still try to resolve the issue amicably. Have you considered approaching the builder directly or filing a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) or the National Consumer Helpline?

Human: I have been following up continually since the last 2 years via calls and emails.

Bot: It seems like a prolonged delay. Considering it's been more than 2 years since the incident occurred in 2019, please note that the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. However, we can still try to pursue the matter.

Can you please provide me with the name and contact details of the representative you've been dealing with at Aditya Builders & Developers?

Human: I prefer sending legal notice.

Bot: I can help you draft a legal notice. Before that, could you please provide me with the exact address of Aditya Builders and Developers, so I can include it in the notice?

Human: Sure. My details are: Mrs. Swati Joshi w/o Mr. Santosh Joshi, residing at Flat No. BF-3, 1st Floor, Perry’s Arcade, Near Sharda Classic, Fatorda, Margao – Salcette Goa- 403602, I am a house wife. The  Opposite Party details are: 2. M/s Aditya Builders and Developers Office at Sincro Towers B-2, 2nd Floor, Behind Margao Municipality, Margao Salcette – Goa- 403601

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. I can assist you in drafting a legal notice. 

Before I draft the notice, can you please confirm the relief you are seeking from the builders? Are you looking for a refund of the amount you paid, possession of the flat, or something else?

Human: Thank you. I want to file a consumer complaint; can you guide me?

Bot: To file a consumer complaint, you can follow these steps:

1.  You can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC), depending on the value of the goods or services and the territorial jurisdiction.

2.  You can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) if the value of the goods or services exceeds ₹1 crore.

3.  You can file a complaint online through the Consumer Protection E-Filing System (CP-EFS) or in person at the consumer court.

The complaint should be filed in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum having jurisdiction over the area where you reside. You can find the list of District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forums at https://ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html. Please note that the complaint should be filed within 2 years from the date of the cause of action. Since the cause of action in your case is in 2019, you should file the complaint before 2021.
