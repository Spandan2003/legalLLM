Human: I was served unhygienic food at the restaurant.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with the restaurant. Thank you for sharing this with me.

To help you further, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was the food spoiled, undercooked, or was there something else that made it unhygienic?

Human: Yes, I informed the supplier, supervisor and the manager, Mr. SArangabani and even showed them the rice having a piece of wire and expressed my displeasure about the unhygienic food served. But they didn’t provide any alternative meals nor did they take any remedial measures to insure the good quality food is served to the customer.

Bot: The incident occurred on September 7, 2020, which is more than 2 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. I would advise you to consider taking action as soon as possible to avoid missing this deadline.

Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from the restaurant or the management, such as a refund, compensation, or any other form of redressal?

Human: Yes, after having lunch the opposite party has issued the bill no 22671 which mentions the total cost of lunch was Rs. 517/-

Bot: The incident occurred on 7th September 2020, which is more than 2 years ago. Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. You may still consider filing a complaint, but you may need to provide a valid reason for the delay.

Would you like to consider filing a complaint or would you like to explore any soft remedies with the restaurant?

Human: I don’t want to go for mediation as I have already approached the other party to resolve the issue, but to no avail. I would like to file a complaint with the consumer forum. What is the procedure to approach the consumer forum?

Bot: You can approach the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (District Commission) as the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed one crore rupees. You can file a complaint with the District Commission under section 34 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

To file a complaint, you will need to submit a written complaint to the District Commission, providing details of the incident, including the date, time, and location of the incident, the goods or services purchased, and the amount paid. You will also need to attach a copy of the bill and any other relevant documents.

You can download the complaint form from the National Consumer Helpline website (consumerhelpline.gov.in) or obtain it from the District Commission's office. You will need to fill out the form and submit it to the District Commission, along with the required documents and a fee.

The District Commission will then forward your complaint to the opposite party, and they will be given an opportunity to respond. If the opposite party fails to respond or if the District Commission is satisfied that the complaint has merit, it may pass an order in your favor.

You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for assistance with filing your complaint.

Bot: The total amount you paid for the lunch is Rs. 517. What kind of relief are you seeking from the consumer forum? Are you looking for a refund of the amount, compensation for the unhygienic food, or something else?

Human: Unfortunately, I did not capture any photographs, but I do have a video of the incident.As for health issues, none of us experienced immediate discomfort, but the presence of a foreign object in the meal was alarming.

Bot: Having a video of the incident can be a strong piece of evidence. Considering the incident occurred on 7.09.2020, you have until 7.09.2022 to file a complaint with the consumer forum. Since today's date is 26.09.2024, your time frame to file a complaint has expired. I would recommend filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for immediate assistance and guidance on the next steps. Would you like me to provide you with the location-based helpline number for your area?

Human: I was fine and did not face any health issues.

Bot: Now, let's discuss the relief you are seeking. What kind of compensation or action do you want the consumer forum to take against the restaurant? Are you looking for a refund, compensation for the meal, or something else?

Human: I would prefer to file the complaint with the consumer forum in Madurai, as that is where I reside. Additionally, how much compensation is reasonably expected from  the opposite party and what is the procedure to file a complaint.

Bot: Filing a complaint in Madurai will be more convenient for you.

As for compensation, considering the incident, you may claim compensation for the defective service, emotional distress, and any other losses incurred. A reasonable amount can be Rs. 50,000 to 1 lakh.

To file a complaint, you'll need to draft a complaint application, which I can assist you with. You can also use the Consumer Helpline's online complaint portal to file a complaint. The portal is available at consumerhelpline.gov.in. 

Before filing the complaint, we'll need to draft a complaint application, which includes details such as your name, address, contact information, the opposite party's name and address, a brief description of the incident, and the relief you're seeking.
