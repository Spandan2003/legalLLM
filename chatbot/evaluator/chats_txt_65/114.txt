Human: I had to leave the movie theatre halfway through the movie due to unhygienic ambience but my ticket fare was not refunded

Bot: That's unfortunate. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to the unhygienic ambience in the movie theatre? Was it due to poor cleaning, pest infestation, or something else?

Human: On 04/02/2022 (4th February, 2022), I went to Suave, a movie theatre, to watch a movie, but much to my disappointment and shock, the hall was not maintained properly with empty plastic bottles and chocolate wrappers strewn all over the place. Also, I spotted spoiled leftover food because of which there was a foul smell inside the theatre which made me nauseous, so I had to leave the premises.

Bot: The incident occurred on 04/02/2022. That's more than 2 years ago. Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, the time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. If you don't file a complaint within this time frame, it might be difficult to pursue legal action.

However, if you're interested in pursuing a complaint, I can guide you through the process. Can you please tell me more about the movie theatre, Suave? What is the location of the theatre and do you have any contact information for them?

Human: Before leaving, I requested the manager to clean the place, and if not immediately, at least during the intermission, but the opposite party refused to pay heed to my requests.

Bot: That's unfortunate. Did you speak to the manager or any other staff member about a refund after you left the theatre?

Human: Yes, I did. I sent an email to the opposite party (suave1234@gmail.com) on 05/02/2022 narrating in detail the incident and asked for compensation, but to no avail.

Bot: It's been over 2 years since the incident occurred (4th February 2022). Unfortunately, under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. If you don't file a complaint within this time frame, you may not be eligible for relief. However, I can still guide you on the process and provide you with options. Would you like to proceed with filing a complaint or explore other alternatives, such as a soft remedy or a compromise?

Human: Yes. Sent a legal notice whereby the theatre was advised to comply with the request for compensation to the tune of Rs 10,000 for the mental distress caused to him, but received no reply.

Bot: It's been over 2 years since the incident, which is past the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint in India. Unfortunately, you may not be eligible to file a complaint now. However, I can still guide you on the next steps you could have taken. If you're interested, I can provide you with information on how to draft a complaint and the possible forums where you could have filed it.

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: Before proceeding, let me remind you that the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, which is more than 2 years ago. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. You may want to consider filing an application for condonation of delay, which requires a notarized affidavit explaining the reasons for the delay.

Would you like to proceed with filing a complaint, or would you like to explore other options, such as a soft remedy or seeking assistance from the National Consumer Helpline?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I need more specific information about your location to guide you further. Could you please provide me with the name of your city or state? That way, I can assist you in finding the appropriate consumer forum to file your complaint.

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you share a template that I could use for reference

Bot: Here's a template for a consumer complaint that you can use as a reference:

Subject: Complaint against Suave for Unhygienic Ambience and Failure to Refund Ticket Fare

We, [Your Name], submit this complaint against Suave for their failure to maintain a clean and hygienic environment in their premises and for not refunding our ticket fare despite our request.

On 04/02/2022, we visited Suave to watch a movie.

The foul smell emanating from the premises made us nauseous, and we were forced to leave the premises.

We requested the manager to clean the place and, if not immediately, at least during the intermission. However, the manager refused to pay heed to our request. We sent an email to Suave on 05/02/2022, narrating the incident and requesting compensation for the mental distress caused. However, we have not received any response from them.

We are seeking compensation of Rs 10,000 for the mental distress caused to us due to the unhygienic ambience and failure to refund our ticket fare.

**RELIEF SOUGHT**

We pray that this Hon'ble Forum may be pleased to pass an order directing Suave to:

1. Refund our ticket fare in full.
