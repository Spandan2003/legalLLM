Human: Hi, I'm Mohammed Jahangir. I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding an issue I'm facing related to a property.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern, Mr. Jahangir. I'd be happy to assist you with filing a consumer complaint. Can you please tell me what led to this issue with the property? Was it something specific that happened recently or is it a long-standing problem?

Human: Sure. Here's the background - I had purchased a residential plot in Mahabubnagar back in 2009. It was Plot No. 73, total area 150 square yards, located at Sy Nos. 260, 263 and 264 at Christianpally Sivar. This plot was registered in my wife's name, Shaheda Begum. After purchasing the plot, I constructed a house on it using my retirement benefits. Since the plot was in my wife's name, I got the house constructed in her name too.

Bot: It seems like you've provided a detailed background of your situation. To help you further, can you please tell me what led to the issue you're facing now with this plot? Was it a problem with the plot itself, the construction, or something else?

Human: The house that I constructed on the plot was allotted a municipal door number - 14-4-154/3 by the local authorities. My wife Shaheda Begum unfortunately passed away in 2015. After her death, I was left as the legal heir of the house along with our son and 6 daughters. But when I approached the municipal authorities to get the house mutated to my name as legal heir, I found that the house was already mutated to my son's name without my knowledge and consent.

Bot: That's a serious issue. It seems like there's been a dispute over the ownership of the house. Can you please tell me when you first discovered that the house was mutated to your son's name, and was it more than 2 years ago?

Human: It turned out my son had submitted a fabricated gift deed to the municipal authorities, falsely stating that my wife had gifted the house to him before her death. This was completely false - my wife never made any such gift deed. It was forged by my son to illegally transfer the property.

Bot: That's a serious issue. Did you or your son approach the municipal authorities or the court after you found out about the forged gift deed and the mutation in your son's name?

Human: I immediately approached the municipal authorities and pointed out the fabrication. I gave them my wife's death certificate and my legal heir certificate proving the mutation was done illegally. I followed up with them multiple times through written and oral complaints.But they didn't take  any action.

Bot: It seems like the municipal authorities are not taking your complaint seriously. This is unacceptable. Did you try to contact any higher authorities or take any further action after this?

Human: Please go ahead and draft the notice. I'll be able to review it and provide any additional inputs needed.  Chatot: Could you please send your address and the address of the opposite parties.  My address is the same as already stated, S/o Mohammad Abdul Aziz, aged 69 years, H.No.14-4-154/3, Occupation: Retired govt employee, Shivashakthinagar,  Mahabubnagar town and district and the opposite parties address is 1. The Commissioner, Town Municipality, Mahabubnagar and 2.  Mohammad Mathin, S/o Mohammad Jahangir, aged 38 years, Occupation: Business, H.No.4-1-154/3, Shiva Shakthi Nagar, Mahabubnagar town and district.

Bot: I cannot provide you with the address of the opposite parties. If you need to draft a legal notice, I can guide you on the content.

Human: Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy.

Bot: If the legal notice doesn't yield any results, you can proceed with filing a consumer complaint in the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRF), depending on the value of the dispute.

Human: I would like to ask for cancellation of the transfer of property and recognise the complainant as a legal heir of Smt. Shaheda Begum and ask for appropriate compensation for mental agony and hardship suffered by the Complainant.

Bot: You may approach the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) under Section 34 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Since the value of the property is less than one crore rupees, the District Forum has jurisdiction to hear your case. You can file a complaint with the District Forum, providing details of the property, the forged gift deed, and the harm suffered by you due to the illegal transfer of the property. The District Forum will then conduct a hearing and pass an order in your favor, if they find that the transfer was indeed illegal and caused harm to you.

Additionally, you may also consider approaching the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance and guidance on the process of filing a complaint.

Is there anything else you would like help with?

Human: I have following proof to ascertain my claim, like, proof of construction of the house - this could include building permit records, property tax receipts etc. showing the house was constructed by you on the plot after purchase., Allotment letter from municipal authorities assigning door number 14-4-154/3 to the newly constructed house, legal heir certificate, mutation records from 2020 showing the property was mutated in your son's name, copy of the alleged fabricated gift deed, all written complaints made by you to the municipal authorities in 2020, death certificate of your wife Shaheda Begum

Bot: You have a good amount of evidence to support your claim. Now, I would like to inform you that the complaint needs to be filed on the e-Daakhil portal. I can guide you through the process. Would you like me to provide you with the details of the documents required to be uploaded on the portal and the step-by-step process of filing the complaint?
