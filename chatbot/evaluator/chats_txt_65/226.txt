Human: I was provided a non-AC bus instead of the AC bus which was booked. What are my remedies?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. Can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was it a mistake by the bus operator or was it a miscommunication?

Human: I booked my tickets on 17th January 2013 for travelling from Thrissur to Chennai on 18 January 2013 in an AC bus through Redbus. I paid Rs. 4, 400 for this. However, the bus which was arranged by the bus provider Maruthi Travels was a non-AC bus.

Bot: I can sense your frustration. Since the incident occurred on January 18, 2013, it has been more than 11 years, which is beyond the 2-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India. Unfortunately, you may not be able to pursue legal action in this matter.

However, I can still guide you on the soft remedies you can explore. You can try contacting Redbus and Maruthi Travels to express your dissatisfaction and request a refund or compensation. They may consider your request, especially if you can provide evidence of your original booking and the discrepancy in the service provided.

Additionally, you may also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this issue?

Human: Yes. Upon entering the non-AC bus, I immediately contacted the manager of Maruthi Travels. He promised that he will arrange the A/c bus from Palakkad to Chennai and requested me to catch the bus to Palakkad. Upon reaching Palakkad, the A/c bus did not come. Finally they sent a Maruthi Omni van. Due to this, I arrived late and missed an important test conducted by the college for assessing internals of Semester II. Even after repeated requests, neither the bus service provider nor the booking agent has refunded my money.

Bot: I understand the situation. Since the incident occurred on January 18, 2013, which is more than 2 years ago, you might be facing a challenge in filing a complaint now. However, I can still guide you on the possible steps you can take.

Considering the circumstances, it seems like you have a strong case for a refund. You could draft a legal notice to the bus service provider and the booking agent, stating the incident, the promised resolution, and the lack of refund.

Would you like me to help you with drafting a sample legal notice?

Human: I want a full refund of the tickets along with compensation.

Bot: Given the circumstances, you have a strong case for a full refund and compensation. I can help you draft a notice to Maruthi Travels and Redbus. Would you like me to guide you through the process of sending a legal notice?

Also, please note that as the incident occurred on January 18, 2013, it has been over 11 years. While this might not affect your claim, it's essential to consider the statute of limitations for consumer disputes in India, which is 2 years from the date of the incident. However, in exceptional cases, the court may consider extending the time limit.

Would you like me to proceed with drafting a legal notice or would you like to know more about the next steps?

Human: Yes, please.

Bot: Here's a draft of the legal notice:

**NOTICE**

To,
Maruthi Travels,
[Address of Maruthi Travels]

Subject: Deficiency in Service and Demand for Refund and Compensation

Respected Sir/Madam,

Re: Non-provision of AC bus as booked and promised

This is to bring to your notice that I, [Your Name], had booked a ticket for AC bus from Thrissur to Chennai on 18th January 2013 through Redbus for a sum of Rs. 4,400. However, when I boarded the bus, I was provided a non-AC bus instead of the AC bus as booked and promised. I immediately brought this to the notice of the manager of Maruthi Travels, who assured me that he would arrange an AC bus from Palakkad to Chennai. However, no such arrangement was made, and I was finally provided a Maruthi Omni van, which made me arrive late and miss an important test conducted by my college.

I have repeatedly requested for a refund of the amount paid and compensation for the mental agony suffered, but to no avail. I request you to take immediate action in this regard and refund the entire amount of Rs. 4,400 along with compensation for the mental agony suffered.

Please confirm in writing that the refund and compensation will be made within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

Please note that this is just a draft, and you should modify it as per your specific needs and circumstances. Also, make sure to keep a record of the notice and any subsequent correspondence.

Subject: Deficiency in Service and Demand for Refund

Respected Sir/Madam,

Re: Deficiency in Service and Demand for Refund

This is to bring to your notice that I, N.Sivasubramanian, S/o.A.S.Narayanan, residing at 'Lakshmi Nilayam", TMC 2/1170, Third Street, Hari Nagar, Punkunnam P.O., Thrissur, Pin-680 002, had booked an AC bus ticket from Thrissur to Chennai on 17th January 2013 through your office for a sum of Rs. 4,400. However, upon boarding the bus, I was provided with a non-AC bus instead of the AC bus as booked. Despite my repeated requests, the issue was not resolved, and I was made to travel in a Maruthi Omni van from Palakkad to Chennai, which resulted in me missing an important test conducted by my college.

I have already brought this to the notice of your office and the Redbus booking agent, but unfortunately, neither of you has taken any action to resolve this issue or refund my money.

In view of the above, I demand a full refund of the amount paid, along with compensation for the mental agony and distress caused to me due to your deficiency in service.

I request you to take immediate action to resolve this issue and refund my money within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice.

If I do not hear from you within the stipulated time, I shall be forced to approach the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum for further action.

Yours faithfully,

N.Sivasubramanian
S/o.A.S.Narayanan
