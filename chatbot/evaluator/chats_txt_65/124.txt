Human: I purchased a software from a reputed SAAS company, but there were issues with it that were not rectified even after intimation. What do I do now?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to the problem with the software? Was it a functionality issue, a bug, or something else?

Human: On 04/02/2022 (4th February, 2022), I purchased a software for my school Rs 4,50,000/- All the terms and conditions were accepted. The software was installed on 24/02/2022, but from day 1, we have not been able to use the product. We realized that there were some technical issues involved, so brought it to the notice of the company immediately, and even paid Rs 3500 for fixing it. But the company did not provide any kind of technical support. Instead, it terminated the service agreement on 05/05/2022.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. The incident occurred on 04/02/2022, which is within the 2-year time frame. You've also mentioned that you've already paid for a fix and still didn't receive the required support.

Can you please provide more information about the software company? What is its name, and do you have any contact details or a registered address for them?

Human: Training sessions on the use of the software were conducted between 20/02/2022 and 23/02/2022.

Bot: That's helpful information. It seems that the issues with the software started soon after it was installed. Did you try to contact the company again after they terminated the service agreement on 05/05/2022 to resolve the matter or get a refund?

Human: Yes, we sent multiple emails, but received no response.

Bot: It seems like you've made efforts to resolve the issue amicably. Since the incident occurred on 4th February 2022, it's within the 2-year time frame. What kind of relief are you seeking in this matter?

Human: Yes, sent a legal notice on 10/05/2022 (10th May, 2022 was asked to rectify the issue, or refund the purchase cost within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice, and also pay Rs 50,000/- as compensation, but received no response

Bot: Since it's been more than 2 years since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, you may not be able to file a new case. However, you can still consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps.

Additionally, you can also consider approaching the National Commission as the value of the goods or services paid as consideration (Rs 4,50,000) exceeds one crore rupees.

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, it has been over 2 years. I would like to inform you that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. However, I can still guide you on the process, but please note that the chances of success might be limited due to the delay.

Considering the value of the software is over 4 lakhs, you can approach the State Commission. I can help you draft a complaint. Would you like me to provide the draft of the complaint and the notice you sent to the company?

Human: It is in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I'm not aware of the specific location of the city of Cosmos. Could you please provide me with the name of the state or district where your school is located? This will help me assist you better.

Also, you mentioned that the incident occurred on 04/02/2022. Since the statue of limitation for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years, you still have time to file a complaint.
