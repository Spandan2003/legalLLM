Human: Hi. I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding a product I ordered online which turned out to be defective. I sent it back through the registered post as advised but the parcel got lost in transit.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.

To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to the product being defective? Was it a manufacturing defect, or was there something else?

Human: Sure. My name is T. Kavitha, I'm 35 years old and work as a bank employee at the State Bank of India's Mahabubnagar branch. I reside in Mahabubnagar town in the Mahabubnagar district of Telangana.

Bot: Thank you, T. Kavitha, for sharing this information with me. Now, let's focus on your consumer complaint. You mentioned that the product you ordered online turned out to be defective and you sent it back through the registered post as advised by the seller. However, the parcel got lost in transit. Can you please tell me the approximate date when you sent the parcel back to the seller?

Human: I had ordered a remote control toy car for my son from Amazon.in 07.01.2019.  It was a "Toy House Fast n Furious Lykan Hypersport Car'' worth ₹12,499. When I received the delivery on 15.01.2019., I found that the car had some manufacturing defect. It was not working properly.

Bot: You ordered a toy car from Amazon.in on 07.01.2019 and received it on 15.01.2019, but it had a manufacturing defect. Did you try to contact Amazon customer service or return the product before sending it back through registered post? Also, did you receive any acknowledgement or confirmation from Amazon regarding the return or replacement of the product?

Human: Yes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer support by email and also left a review detailing the defect. They got back saying I should return the item to them for a refund.

Bot: It seems like Amazon asked you to return the item. Did you return the item as per their instructions, and if so, what happened to the return? You mentioned earlier that the parcel got lost in transit. When did you send the return parcel and what was the tracking number?

Human: Amazon instructed me to send it back through India Post as they have a tie-up. As advised, on 12th Feb 2019, I shipped the product from the Mahabubnagar post office to Amazon's warehouse in Gurgaon, Haryana. It was registered parcel number CA012164954IN and I paid ₹650 postal charges.Even after 2-3 weeks, the tracking status still showed that the parcel was in transit. So I started following up with the post office repeatedly to trace it but there was no proper response.

Bot: It seems like the parcel got lost in transit. Since more than 2 years have passed since the incident (the current date is 26th September 2024), you might face a challenge in pursuing a claim for the lost parcel. However, I would still like to guide you through the process.

Since you had sent the parcel through India Post, you can try to file a complaint with the Department of Posts. You can also contact the Mahabubnagar post office where you sent the parcel and ask them to investigate the matter. 

Considering the product was defective and you had already informed Amazon, you can also consider filing a consumer complaint with the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (CDRC) in Telangana. The grounds for complaint in this case would be the defective product and the loss of the parcel during return.

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a complaint or notice to Amazon or the post office?

Human: After almost 6 months of me persistently following up, the Mahabubnagar post office finally sent me a letter saying my parcel was received in Gurgaon sorting facility but then they lost track of it and couldn't trace it anymore.

Bot: It seems like a frustrating experience. As you've been following up for over a year now, I want to caution you that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since your incident occurred on January 15, 2019, and it's now 2024, you still have time to file a complaint.

Considering the parcel got lost in transit and you've already contacted Amazon, would you like to pursue a legal action against Amazon or the post office, or would you like to explore any soft remedies?

Human: Yes, in their letter dated 23rd September 2019, they said they were closing the case and offered me Rs. 500 as goodwill compensation. I refused to accept it since the toy car was worth ₹12,499. This is totally unfair.

Bot: The compensation offered seems inadequate considering the value of the item. The incident occurred in January 2019, which means the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is almost over. However, considering the circumstances, you may still have a valid case. Did you consider taking any legal action against Amazon or the post office for this incident?

Human: I complained to the senior officials through their public grievance portal. But other than sympathising, they also did not offer any resolution.

Bot: It's unfortunate that the higher authorities didn't provide a satisfactory resolution. Given that the parcel was lost and the product was defective, I think it's time to consider filing a consumer complaint against Amazon and the postal department. The incident happened on January 2019, which is more than 2 years ago. Unfortunately, this means that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019's 2-year time limit for filing a complaint has expired. However, we can still try to explore other options for a resolution. Would you like to draft a complaint to the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Mahabubnagar, as per the Consumer Protection Act, 1986?

Human: Kindly draft a legal  notice.

Bot: Based on the information you provided, I'll draft a sample legal notice. Please note that this is a general template and you should consult a lawyer before sending the actual notice.

Ms. T. Kavitha 

Complainant 

You can now proceed to file the complaint at the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar. You can also reach out to the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance in filing the complaint. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Human: Yes, it will be great if you can give me a step-by-step guide on how I can file this.

Bot: Here is a step-by-step guide to help you file your consumer complaint on the e-Daakhil portal:

1.  Go to the e-Daakhil portal at [www.edaakhil.nic.in](http://www.edaakhil.nic.in) and click on the "File a New Case" button.

2.  Select the type of complaint you want to file, which is a consumer complaint.

3.  Fill in the details as required, including your name, address, contact number, and email ID.

4.  Select the opposite party's name, address, and contact details from the list of registered entities.

5.  Upload the required documents, including the complaint, affidavit, and Memorandum of Parties.

6.  Fill in the details of the case, including the cause of action, jurisdiction, and relief sought.

7.  Pay the filing fee as per the prescribed rate.

8.  Submit the complaint and take a printout of the acknowledgement receipt.

9.  You can also track the status of your complaint on the e-Daakhil portal.

10. If you face any issues during the filing process, you can contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or the e-Daakhil helpdesk for assistance.

Also, you can use the UMANG App for filing complaints. You can download the UMANG App from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

Do you have any questions regarding the e-Daakhil portal or the UMANG App?

Human: Got it. I will not agree for mediation.

Bot: In that case, after you have paid the necessary fees, the complaint will be filed, and you will receive an acknowledgment slip. The opposite party will be served with a copy of the complaint, and they will have 30 days to file a written statement of defence. The court may then schedule a hearing, and you will be required to appear in court to present your case. You can also use the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. Do you need any help with anything else?

Human: No. Thank you very much for the assistance!
