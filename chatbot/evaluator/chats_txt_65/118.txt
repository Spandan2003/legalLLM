Human: I purchased an oven, but within a few months, it stopped working. The seller neither fixed the issue nor replaced the product. What do I do now?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.

To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to the oven stopping working? Was it due to a manufacturing defect, or was it caused by any other reason?

Human: I purchased a microwave oven on 04/02/2022. Within a few weeks, it stopped working, well within the warranty period. The technician from the sellerâ€™s company informed that a few parts would have to be replaced, and that it would be done in about a week as the parts were not in stock. Many days went by, but the new parts never arrived.

Bot: It seems like the seller is not taking responsibility for the repair or replacement of the oven despite the warranty period. This is a clear case of a defective product and the seller's failure to honor their warranty.

Considering the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, the statute of limitations for filing a complaint is 2 years. Since today's date is 26/09/2024, you still have time to take action.

Can you please provide me with the contact information of the seller, including their name, phone number, and address, if you have it? This will help me better understand the situation and provide you with further guidance.

Human: It stopped working on 15/03/2022

Bot: The incident occurred on 15/03/2022. You mentioned that the oven was still under warranty at that time. Since you purchased the oven on 04/02/2022, it's well within the 2-year time frame for filing a consumer complaint. 

You also mentioned that the seller's technician was supposed to replace the parts, but it didn't happen. Did the seller refuse to entertain any further requests or did they simply not follow up on the repair?

Human: Rs 10,000

Bot: You mentioned that the seller's technician informed you that a few parts would have to be replaced, but they never arrived. Did you contact the seller again after the initial communication from the technician, and if so, what was their response?

Human: When I contacted the service center, I was told the matter would be taken up with higher authorities and that it would be resolved soon, but I never heard from them after that.

Bot: It seems like the seller's service center is not taking adequate action to resolve the issue. You have the option to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for immediate assistance.

Before we proceed with that, would you like me to draft a legal notice to the seller, outlining the issue and seeking a replacement or refund for the defective oven?

Human: Yes, I did. Sent emails but received no favourable response.

Bot: It seems like the seller's service center has not been responsive to your issue. As the incident occurred within the warranty period, you may be eligible for a replacement or refund. Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to the seller to resolve this issue?

Human: Yes, sent a legal notice on 23/04/2022 (23rd February, 2022) whereby the opposite party was asked to replace the defective components, or refund the purchase cost of the product, and also pay Rs 15,000/- as compensation, but received no response.

Bot: Since you sent the legal notice on 23/04/2022, which is within the 2-year time frame, you are still eligible to pursue legal action. However, considering the notice was sent on 23/04/2022 but the incident occurred on 15/03/2022, we should consider the date of the incident for the purpose of filing a complaint. Since today's date is 26/09/2024, you have time to file a complaint.

Would you like to proceed with drafting a complaint or would you like to explore other options?

Human: A complaint.

Bot: You can file a complaint before the District Commission, as the value of the goods paid as consideration does not exceed one crore rupees. You can approach the District Commission under section 34 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

Before filing a complaint, I can help you draft a Memorandum of Parties and Affidavit. Would you like me to assist you in drafting these documents?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I couldn't find any information about a city called "Cosmos". Could you please provide the name of the state or district where you reside? This will help me provide you with the correct location-based helpline number for your area.

Human: I want to file a complaint

Bot: To file a complaint, you can approach the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Cosmos. The value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed one crore rupees, so you can file a complaint before the District Commission. You can download the complaint form from the National Consumer Helpline website (consumerhelpline.gov.in) or obtain it from the District Commission's office. Please fill out the form and submit it along with the required documents and fees. What else would you like help with?
