Human: I paid money for developing an android application, but the developer did not fulfill his promise. What do I do now?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you with this issue.

Can you please tell me what led to this issue with the developer not fulfilling his promise? Was there a specific agreement or contract in place, or was it a verbal agreement?

Human: I entered into an agreement with one Aestheticszz Private Limited for development of an android application. The company promised to finish it within a period of 90 working days from 04/02/2022. The agreement also stipulated time limits for various stages of the process, and I was to be apprised of the same at regular intervals. Besides, I paid a token advance of Rs 40,000/- on 06/02/2022.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. It seems like the incident occurred on or after 04/02/2022. Since today's date is 26/09/2024, the incident is within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. 

Can you please provide me with information about the current status of the application development? Has the developer stopped responding to your queries, or has the project been abandoned?

Human: The company did not provide any updates. There was no communication regarding the progress made even after the expiry of the time period agreed to in the contract.

Bot: It seems like the company failed to meet their end of the bargain. Can you please tell me when did you last contact the company regarding this issue, and did you receive any response from them?

Human: The total consideration for the service was 1,30,000/- and the final instalment of Rs 50,000/- was paid on 05/03/2022. The company was supposed to share the UI/UX within 20 days from the date of receipt of the token advance.

Bot: It seems like the company has not fulfilled their obligations as per the agreement. Have you tried contacting the company to resolve the issue?

Human: Yes, I sent many emails, but received no response.

Bot: That's unfortunate. The incident occurred on 04/02/2022, and it seems like you paid the final instalment on 05/03/2022. You've been trying to reach out to the company since then. Did you experience any loss due to the company's inaction, such as wasted time or additional expenses?

Human: Yes, I sent a legal notice on 23/03/2022 (23rd March, 2022) asking the company to refund the money already paid towards availing its services, and also pay Rs 50,000/- as compensation

Bot: It has been over 2 years since the incident occurred. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a 2-year time limit for filing a complaint. As today's date is 26/09/2024, it might be challenging to pursue legal action. However, we can still explore other options.

Considering your case, it seems like the company has failed to deliver on their promises, failed to communicate with you, and you've already sent a legal notice. What would you like to do next? Would you like me to help you draft a follow-up notice or explore other soft remedies?

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: To file a consumer complaint, you can approach the District Commission under Section 34 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, as the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed one crore rupees.

Before proceeding, I would like to warn you that the incident occurred on or before 05/03/2022, and the legal time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since today's date is 26/09/2024, you have already exceeded the time limit. However, you can still try to file a complaint, but it might not be entertained by the consumer forum due to the delay.

Would you like to proceed with filing a complaint despite the time limit?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I couldn't find any information on a city named "Cosmos". Could you please provide me with the name of your city or state? This will help me guide you on the next steps and provide you with the correct contact details for filing a consumer complaint.

Also, just to confirm, you would like to file a complaint against Aestheticszz Private Limited for not fulfilling their obligations under the agreement?

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you share a template that I could use for reference

Bot: Here's a template for a consumer complaint that you can use as a reference:
