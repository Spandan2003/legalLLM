Human: I ordered and paid for 100kg pepper and 1kg cumin from the opposite party but never received the items. What are my remedies?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd be happy to help you with that.

To better understand your situation, could you please tell me what led to this issue? Was the order placed online or through a physical store? Was there a tracking number provided, and if so, what is the status of the tracking?

Human: I ordered 100 kg of pepper and 1 kg cumin in two orders from Real More International via vide order no. 2, 4. I paid the full amount of Rs.21,800/- and Rs. 20,895/-, vide Invoice no. W2, Date: 10/12/2021 in advance. In fact, I was also provided the lorry receipts of the same through Whatsapp and Mr Ashik, claiming to be the CEO of the company stated that the item was dispatched. However, the receipts were fake and nothing was ever dispatched.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. It seems like you've been a victim of a scam. The fact that you were provided fake lorry receipts and the company never dispatched the items is a clear case of unfair trade practice.

Can you please tell me the date when you first realized that the items were not dispatched? And also, do you have any communication with the company after you realized that the items were not dispatched?

Human: Yes, I did report the issue to them several times. In fact, I visited their office multiple times but it was often locked. I even asked them to either provide the product or refund the full amount paid but have received no satisfactory response.

Bot: It seems like the company is not responding to your complaints. Given that you have already made multiple attempts to reach out to them, and they have not provided any satisfactory response, it appears that you may need to take further action.

Can you please confirm the date when you first reported this issue to the company? Also, are you aware of the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India, which is 2 years from the date of the incident?

Human: I only want compensation.

Bot: Given the circumstances, you have every right to seek compensation for the amount you paid to Real More International. Since they have refused to refund or provide the products, you can consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Forum or District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. 

Before that, I can help you draft a legal notice to the company, requesting them to refund the amount. Would you like me to assist you in drafting the notice? 

Also, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance.

Human: I want a full refund of the amount paid (Rs 42,695) and compensation of Rs 20,000.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 10/12/2021, it's been over 2 years, which might make it difficult to file a complaint in a consumer court. However, we can still try to pursue other options. Have you considered filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or using the e-daakhil portal (http://edaakhil.nic.in/) for assistance?

Human: Yes, please.
