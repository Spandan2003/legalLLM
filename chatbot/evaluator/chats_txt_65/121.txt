Human: I was sold a defective mobile phone. What is my remedy?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with your consumer grievance.

To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to the problem with the mobile phone? Was it a manufacturing defect, a software issue, or something else?

Human: On 04/02/2022, I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of ABC Mobiles Private Limited, and purchased a Cenza 6+ bearing IMEI No. 65324519846753 for a sum of Rs 50,000/- On 06/02/2022, two days after the date of purchase, I noticed a deep crack on the top left corner of the display screen, and I had not dropped the phone even once since the purchase.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. The incident occurred on 06/02/2022, which is more than 2 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. 

Considering this, you may not be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. However, I can still guide you on other possible soft remedies or alternatives.

If you're still interested in pursuing a resolution, I can help you draft a complaint or a notice to the company. 

Would you like me to proceed with drafting a complaint or would you like to explore soft remedies?

Human: When I contacted the retailer, I was told that physical damage was not covered, but the point is that the crack existed even at the time of purchase although it was not very apparent/noticeable then. So, when thereâ€™s no fault on my part, I should not be expected to adjust with a product of sub-standard quality.

Bot: It seems like you're saying that the damage was already present at the time of purchase, and you're not responsible for it. In that case, you can consider approaching the retailer again and asking them to replace or repair the phone.

Before we proceed, I just want to check if you've tried approaching the retailer within the statutory time limit of 2 years from the date of purchase, which in your case would be 26/09/2024.

Human: Warranty period is one year. Actually, I was first told the crack could have occurred due to the pressure exerted by the tight back cover that the company itself provided, and that I could get a replacement, if needed.

Bot: It seems like the retailer initially offered to replace the phone. However, you were later told that physical damage was not covered. This is a bit confusing. Did the retailer ever send you a written communication regarding the warranty claim, or was it just verbal communication?

Human: Yes, multiple times. Finally, when I received a reply to my email, I was told I could only get the phone repaired but I would have to bear the expenses which was not acceptable to me as I needed a replacement.

Bot: It seems like the company is not willing to provide a replacement as per your request. Considering the incident occurred on 06/02/2022, which is more than 2 years ago, I would like to bring to your notice that the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 has a statute of limitations of 2 years for filing a consumer complaint. However, you may still consider filing a complaint if you believe you have a strong case. 

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to the company or would you like to explore other options?

Human: Yes, I sent a notice on 13/02/2022 asking the complainant to replace the defective product, or return the purchase cost of the mobile phone, and also pay Rs 15,000/- as compensation, but received no reply.

Bot: It seems like you have already taken some steps to resolve the issue. Since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, which is more than 2 years ago, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is a concern. However, you can still try to pursue the matter further. 

Have you considered filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the e-daakhil portal for further assistance?

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 06/02/2022, it's within the 2-year time limit. You've already sent a notice, but the company hasn't responded. To file a complaint, you can use the e-daakhil portal or the UMANG App. Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a complaint or would you like to file it directly?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I'm not aware of a city called "Cosmos". Could you please provide the name of the city or district you live in? This information will help me guide you on which consumer forum to file your complaint in.

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you share a template that I could use for reference
