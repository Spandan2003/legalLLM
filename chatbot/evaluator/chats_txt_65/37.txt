Human: I incurred extra expenses on my flight journey from the US to India due to negligent conduct of the travel agency. What should I do now?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you with this issue. To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the extra expenses you incurred due to the travel agency's negligence? Was it related to a flight cancellation, delay, or something else?

Human: As per the original itinerary, my return journey from the US to India was scheduled to take place on the 15th of March, 2022. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to arrive earlier than expected, so I had asked the travel agent to prepone the date of departure to 8th March, 2022. However, due to some issues with respect to the transit visa arrangements, I had to shell out an extra sum of money, and also  could not reach India on time to fulfill my personal commitments.

Bot: It seems like you had to make some last-minute changes to your travel plans due to unforeseen circumstances. The incident occurred on March 8th, 2022. Since you're seeking assistance with a consumer grievance, I'd like to know more about the travel agency's response to your situation. Did they acknowledge your concerns and offer any compensation or assistance for the additional expenses you incurred?

Human: I was asked to pay Rs 80,000 which I paid on 04/03/2022.

Bot: You paid Rs 80,000 on March 4, 2022, as an additional expense due to the travel agency's alleged negligence. Did you inform the travel agency about the issues you faced and the extra expenses you incurred?

Human: Vista Travel Agency Private Limited

Bot: I've taken note of the details. Considering the incident occurred on 04/03/2022, it's within the 2-year time frame for filing a consumer complaint. I'd recommend drafting a formal complaint against Vista Travel Agency Private Limited for their alleged negligence. Would you like me to assist you in drafting a notice or complaint to be sent to the agency?

Human: Airline: Sunset Airlines PNR details: India UserSA – XXXXXX UserSA to India - XXXXXX Date of departure from India: - 01/03/2022 Original date of departure from the UserS: - 15/03/2022 Rescheduled date of departure from the UserS – 08/03/2022 Flight fare (India to US) – Rs 1, 05, 000/- Flight fare (US to India) – Rs 1, 10, 000/-

Bot: It seems like you paid extra for the prepaid visa and other arrangements. The extra amount of Rs 80,000 you paid is not part of the flight fare, which is Rs 2, 15, 000 in total.

You have 2 years from the date of payment (04/03/2022) to file a complaint. Since the incident occurred on 04/03/2022, you are well within the time frame.

Considering your situation, it seems like you may have a case against the travel agency for their negligence. Would you like me to help you draft a legal notice to the travel agency?

Human: Yes, I did. I contacted their customer care on 15/03/2022. They said there was no mistake on their side, and that they had done all that was necessary.

Bot: It seems like the travel agency is not taking responsibility for the extra expenses you incurred. Considering the circumstances, you had to preponed the flight and then paid extra for the transit visa arrangements, which was not your fault.

Since the incident occurred on March 8, 2022, and you're reporting it now, it's within the 2-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India.

Would you like to consider filing a complaint against Vista Travel Agency Private Limited for their alleged negligence and seeking a refund or compensation for the extra expenses you incurred?

Human: They could not help me as the journey details were not updated in their system, so I was forced to pay an extra sum of money to the airline directly for rebooking the flight ticket. I had to pay Rs 80,000 for the same.

Bot: It seems like the airline and travel agency are not taking responsibility for the issue.

As you have already contacted the travel agency and they have denied any mistake, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) against Vista Travel Agency Private Limited.

Before that, I can help you draft a legal notice to the travel agency. Would you like me to provide you with a draft notice?

Human: Yes, I sent a notice dated 20/03/2022 to the travel agency,  but never received a reply to the notice

Bot: It seems like the travel agency hasn't taken any action to rectify the situation. Considering the time that has passed, I would like to remind you that the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since your incident occurred on March 8, 2022, you still have time to pursue the matter.

Would you like me to provide you with a draft of a legal notice to send to the travel agency, or would you like to consider other options such as filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum?

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you could share a template that I could use for reference

Bot: Here's a template for a consumer complaint:
