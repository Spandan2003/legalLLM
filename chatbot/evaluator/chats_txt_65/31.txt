Human: There was an insect in the food served to me at a restaurant. What is my remedy?

Bot: Sorry to hear that you had an unpleasant experience at the restaurant. Thank you for sharing your concern.

To help me better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the insect in your food? Was it a one-time incident or have you had issues with the restaurant before?

Human: I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of ABC  restaurant located in the city of Cosmos on 04/02/2022 at 6:30 pm.

Bot: You visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of ABC restaurant on 04/02/2022 at 6:30 pm. You mentioned that there was an insect in the food served to you. Since the incident occurred more than 2 years ago, please note that the statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India is 2 years. This means that you may not be able to file a complaint through the formal consumer court process at this time.

However, you can still try to resolve the issue through other means. Did you inform the restaurant staff or management about the incident at the time of occurrence? If not, would you like to know the steps you can take to resolve this issue informally?

Human: I paid Rs 500/- in total

Bot: You paid a total of Rs 500 for the food.

Considering the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, please note that the Consumer Protection Act's time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, you still have time to file a complaint.

Can you please tell me if you have already spoken to the restaurant staff or management about this issue, and if so, what was their response?

Human: I visited the restaurant with three of my friends.

Bot: You mentioned that the incident occurred on 04/02/2022. Since the incident is over 2 years old, please note that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. However, you can still try to resolve the issue with the restaurant or file a complaint with the relevant authorities.

Have you approached the restaurant's management or the Food Safety Officer/Designated Officer/DC of your area to report the incident and seek a resolution?

Human: Yes, they did.

Bot: You mentioned that the incident occurred on 04/02/2022. Since the incident is more than 2 years old, you might be facing a limitation issue. However, I can still guide you on the steps you can take. 

You should first try to resolve the issue with the restaurant directly. If they don't respond or provide a satisfactory solution, you can consider filing a complaint with the Food Safety Officer/Designated Officer/DC of your area or the Food Safety Commissioner of the State.

Can you please provide me with the contact details of the restaurant, such as the phone number or email address, so I can guide you further?

Human: Yes, I did, but to no avail. They ignored my complaint.

Bot: The incident occurred on 04/02/2022, which is more than 2 years ago. Unfortunately, as per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, a consumer complaint must be filed within 2 years from the date of the incident. You may not be eligible to file a complaint now. However, I can guide you on what you could have done at that time.

Considering your experience, you could have filed a complaint with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) or the local food safety authority in the city of Cosmos. They would have investigated the matter and taken necessary action against the restaurant if they were found to be at fault.

If you're still interested in pursuing the matter, I can help you draft a legal notice to the restaurant. Would you like me to do that?

Human: Yes, they do. I voiced my concerns in the feedback section that is available on their website, and I also tried calling them on the toll-free number, but there was no response from their side.

Bot: It seems like the restaurant is not taking your complaint seriously. You may want to consider filing a complaint with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) or the local Food Safety Officer in your area. You can also approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) as the value of the goods/services is Rs. 500, which falls under their jurisdiction. I can help you draft a complaint letter or notice if you'd like. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: On 05/02/2022

Bot: You filed your complaint on the next day of the incident. Since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, and you're seeking a remedy now, your complaint is well within the 2-year time limit.

Considering your issue, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Forum. Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to the restaurant?

Human: There was no acknowledgement of the feedback registered, but I have taken a screenshot of it.

Bot: Considering the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, you have approached the restaurant and provided feedback on 05/02/2022, and they haven't responded to your complaint, you may want to consider approaching the Food Safety Officer or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in your area for further assistance.

Before proceeding with any legal action, would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to the restaurant, or would you like to explore other options like filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App?

Human: Yes, I asked them to refund the amount paid for the juice.

Bot: Since more than 2 years have passed since the incident, you might not be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. However, you can still try to resolve the issue amicably with the restaurant. If you're interested, I can help you draft a letter to the restaurant requesting a refund or replacement. Would you like me to do that?

Human: I received a call from their customer service center after about 3 days. However, they denied the allegations, and said that they had taken all the measures that were necessary to keep insects out. They further refused to return the amount paid.

Bot: That's unfortunate. Considering you've already contacted the restaurant's customer support and they've denied your allegations, it seems like you may need to take further action. Have you considered filing a complaint with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) or the local consumer court?

Human: No, I donâ€™t remember

Bot: Considering that it has been over 2 years since the incident (as of today's date, 26th September 2024), you may not be eligible to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. However, you can still try to resolve the issue amicably. Have you thought of drafting a formal letter to the restaurant, stating your complaint, the incident, and your demand for a refund? I can help you draft a sample letter if you'd like.

Human: Not aware of anything like that

Bot: I'd like to inform you that you have about 2 years from the date of incident (04/02/2022) to file a complaint. Since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, you still have time to file a complaint. Would you like to consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the e-daakhil portal for further assistance?

Human: Yes, I have taken photos of the product

Bot: You had mentioned earlier that the incident occurred on 04/02/2022. As per the Consumer Protection Act, the time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since it has been more than 2 years, you may not be eligible to file a complaint under the Act. However, I can guide you on other possible steps you can take.

Would you like to know about the soft remedies or legal options available to you?

Human: Yes, I threw up almost immediately. Later, I went to a clinic when I fell sick due to diarrhea.

Bot: That must have been a distressing experience. Considering your complaint, you may want to consider filing a case against the restaurant for food safety and hygiene negligence. I can help you draft a legal notice to send to the restaurant. Would you like me to provide you with a draft of the notice?

Human: Rs 1000/-

Bot: You have a valid claim for compensation under the Consumer Protection Act. Since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, we are still within the 2-year time limit. I can guide you on drafting a legal notice to the restaurant. Would you like me to help you with that?

Human: I want them to return the money paid for the juice, and also pay a compensation of Rs 6000/- for the medical expenses incurred and also the mental distress caused

Bot: Considering your case, you can approach the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for registration of your complaint. You can also consider filing a complaint with the State Consumer Commission, as the incident occurred on 04/02/2022 and you are now in 2024, which is within the 2-year time limit.

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to the restaurant, or would you like to approach the FSSAI or the State Consumer Commission directly?

Human: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 15/02/2022, but I have not received any reply from them

Bot: You can file a complaint with the Consumer Forum, as your case meets the jurisdiction criteria. You can approach the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) as the amount involved is less than 1 crore. You can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. Would you like me to help you draft a legal notice or a complaint to be filed with the Consumer Forum?

Human: Yes, I would like to

Bot: I can guide you through the process. Since the incident occurred on 04/02/2022, you have two years to file a complaint. However, considering the incident is from 2022, you are well within the time frame. 

Before we proceed, I can help you draft a legal notice. Would you like me to assist you with that?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: You can file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum of the city of Cosmos. You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance.

I can help you draft a legal notice to serve on the restaurant. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you share a template that I could use for reference
