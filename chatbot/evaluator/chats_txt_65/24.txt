Human: Hello. I'm Mr. P.V. Dhananjayudu, an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army. I need help regarding an issue I'm facing with the Municipal Corporation of Mahabubnagar. They are not providing me the tax exemption on my house that I'm eligible for as an ex-serviceman.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern, Mr. Dhananjayudu. I'm here to help you with your issue. To better understand your situation, could you please tell me what led to this issue with the Municipal Corporation of Mahabubnagar? Was there a specific conversation or interaction with them that made you realize you're not getting the tax exemption you're eligible for?

Human: Sure, I'm 71 years old and reside at Plot No.3, H.No.8-6-8/A/20, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar town and district. I'm an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army.

Bot: Thank you for providing the necessary information, Mr. Dhananjayudu. I'd like to clarify a few more details regarding your issue with the Municipal Corporation of Mahabubnagar. Can you please tell me when did you first apply for the tax exemption as an ex-serviceman and when did you notice that it wasn't being provided to you?

Human: Yes, of course. So as part of the rehabilitation program for ex-servicemen, the State Government had allotted me 200 sq yards of land in Survey No. 211/2 at Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar under the ex-servicemen quota. After the land allotment, I constructed a house after taking the required permission from the Mahabubnagar Municipal Corporation, who are the Opposite Party in my complaint. They had provided the construction permission vide letter no. L.R.No.61/BA/298/1046/99 dated 04.02.2000.The Municipal Corporation allotted house number 8-6-8/A/20 for the property after it was constructed. As per government order G.O.Ms.No.83 issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department, dated 15.03.1997, ex-servicemen of the armed forces are eligible for exemption from payment of house tax for one residential property. So based on this government, I am eligible for exemption as an ex-serviceman.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. It seems like you have a clear case for tax exemption as per the government order. However, the Municipal Corporation is not providing you the exemption. 

Could you please tell me the approximate time when you first approached the Municipal Corporation about this issue and when they denied your request for exemption?

Human: I had submitted all the required documents to the Municipal Corporation requesting them to provide me the tax exemption. This includes my ex-serviceman ID proofs, property documents and the Government Order document itself. I submitted this request first on 26.09.2020. Unfortunately, the Municipal Corporation did not accept my application. In fact, on 18.09.2022, before I applied, they had sent me a tax demand notice asking me to pay Rs. 2637 as the annual house tax.. After they sent that demand notice, I submitted another request on 27.09.2022 explaining my eligibility criteria again and asking them to reconsider.

Bot: It seems like you have been trying to get this exemption for a while now. I'm concerned that the Municipal Corporation's response to your request is not in line with the government order you mentioned. The demand notice they sent you on 18.09.2022 is also a cause for concern.

Can you please tell me the date when you first noticed that the Municipal Corporation was not providing you the tax exemption?

Human: Kindly draft me a legal notice.

Bot: Based on the information you provided, I can draft a legal notice for you. However, please note that this is a sample and you may need to modify it according to your specific needs and circumstances.

Respected Sir/Madam,

I, P.V. Dhananjayudu, an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army, am writing to bring to your attention a matter of grave concern regarding the non-exemption of house tax for my property bearing house number 8-6-8/A/20, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar.

As per the Government Order G.O.Ms.No.83 issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department, dated 15.03.1997, ex-servicemen of the armed forces are eligible for exemption from payment of house tax for one residential property. I have been a resident of the above-mentioned property since its construction and have submitted all the necessary documents, including my ex-serviceman ID proofs, property documents, and the Government Order document, to the Municipal Corporation on 26.09.2020 and 27.09.2022, requesting them to provide me the tax exemption.

Despite my repeated requests, the Municipal Corporation has failed to acknowledge my eligibility and has instead sent me a tax demand notice on 18.09.2022, demanding Rs. 2637 as the annual house tax. I request you to take immediate action to rectify this error and grant me the exemption from house tax as per the Government Order.

I request you to confirm in writing within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice that the Municipal Corporation will not demand any house tax from me for the above-mentioned property. If I do not receive a satisfactory response, I will be forced to take further action to protect my rights.

Please find attached a copy of the Government Order and my supporting documents for your reference.

Yours faithfully,

P.V. Dhananjayudu

**NOTICE**

To,
The Municipal Commissioner,
Mahabubnagar Municipality,
Mahabubnagar, Telangana.

Subject: Demand of House Tax Exemption for Ex-Serviceman - Request for Immediate Action

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Plot No. 3, H.No. 8-6-8/A/20, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar.

I, P.V. Dhananjayudu, an Ex-Serviceman of the Indian Army, and the owner of the above-mentioned property, write to bring to your notice the non-acceptance of my application for tax exemption, despite my eligibility as per Government Order No. G.O.Ms.No.83 dated 15.03.1997, issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department.

As per the said Government Order, I am entitled to exemption from payment of house tax for one residential property. However, despite submitting my application on 26.09.2020 and 27.09.2022, along with all necessary documents, including my ex-serviceman ID proofs, property documents, and the Government Order document, I have not received any favorable response from your office.

Furthermore, on 18.09.2022, I received a tax demand notice from your office, demanding Rs. 2637 as annual house tax, which I believe is incorrect and unjustified.

I request you to kindly reconsider my application and grant me the exemption from payment of house tax as per the Government Order. I also request you to cancel the demand notice dated 18.09.2022 and refrain from taking any further action against me.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response from your office within 30 days from the date of receipt of this notice, I shall be forced to take further action to protect my rights.

Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and indicate the steps you will take to resolve this matter.

Yours faithfully,

P.V. Dhananjayudu
Ex-Serviceman and Owner of Plot No. 3, H.No. 8-6-8/A/20, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar.

Please note that this is a sample and you should modify it according to your specific needs and circumstances. Also, please ensure that you keep a record of the notice and its dispatch, and also a copy of the acknowledgement from the Municipal Corporation.

Next step, would you like to proceed with filing a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, or would you like to wait for the response to the notice?

Human: Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy.

Bot: If the legal notice does not result in a favorable response from the Municipal Corporation, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Mahabubnagar. You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for guidance on the process and procedure for filing a complaint.

Human: As a relief I want the opposite party to cancel the house tax demand and issue house tax exemption certificate to the complainant also  ask for Rs. 10000/- Rs as compensation for mental agony and inconvenience caused;

Bot: You can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Mahabubnagar. The complaint should be filed within 2 years from the date of the cause of action, which in this case is the date of the demand notice dated 18.09.2022.

I would suggest you consider filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which has a limitation period of 3 years from the date of the cause of action. Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint under the 1986 Act?

Human: Yes, please do assist me in lodging a proper complaint against them. I am uploading all the necessary documents.
