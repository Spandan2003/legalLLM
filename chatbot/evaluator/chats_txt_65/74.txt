Human: I was delivered a defective power tilling machine which was full of scrap.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.

To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to this problem with the defective power tilling machine? Was it purchased from a physical store, an online platform, or directly from the manufacturer?

Human: In 2018, I visited a workshop in Kolhapur to purchase a power tilling machine (PTM) for my farm. After seeing a demo, I confirmed I wanted to buy it but could not complete the purchase then due to the COVID lockdown.

Bot: It seems like the incident occurred in 2018, which is more than 2 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, you have a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. I would advise you to check if the statute of limitations has expired. If not, we can proceed with the complaint. Can you please confirm if you have tried to contact the workshop or the manufacturer about this issue before?

Human: In May 2021, I contacted the proprietor Mr. Inderjeet again to confirm I wanted to purchase the PTM urgently. I paid the full amount of Rs. 1,13,500 via RTGS on 12/05/2021. This included transportation charges.

Bot: It's been over 3 years since the incident. Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the time limit for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident or from the date when the cause of action arose. Since your incident occurred in 2021, you might have a limited time frame to file a complaint. I would advise you to act quickly.

Can you please tell me what happened when you received the PTM? Did you inspect it before accepting it, and did you notice any defects or issues at that time?

Human: Yes, I have all the documents ready. Inderjeet promised to send a brand new PTM after the payment.

Bot: It's been over 3 years since the purchase. I would like to remind you that under the Consumer Protection Act, you have a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. Since your incident occurred in 2021, you are still within the time limit. However, I would advise you to proceed with caution and consider filing a complaint as soon as possible.

Can you please tell me what happened when you received the PTM? Was it the same condition as you had expected, or was it the defective one you mentioned earlier?

Human: The PTM was delivered on 10/08/2021. But the transporter Avinash Cargo charged me an additional Rs. 4,280 as transportation fee. Also, the invoice from Venkatesh Engineering showed the amount as only Rs. 35,000!

Bot: It seems like there's a discrepancy in the invoice amount and the transportation charge. When you received the PTM, did you inspect it and notice that it was damaged or defective, or was it only when you started using it that you found it to be defective?

Human: Yes! When I called Inderjeet, he said it was a mistake but I should not worry. But the biggest shock was when I opened the package - the PTM was completely defective and scrap! It was not in a condition to be used at all.

Bot: That's unacceptable. The product was not only defective but also not as promised. Did you contact Inderjeet again after discovering the issue?

Human: I approached them multiple times asking for a refund or replacement with a new PTM but they ignored my requests.

Bot: It seems like they're not willing to resolve the issue amicably. Have you considered taking legal action against them? If so, would you like me to guide you on the process of drafting a legal notice to them?

Human: Yes I have saved all the call and email records.

Bot: I think we have enough information to proceed. You have a clear case of deficiency in service and misrepresentation by the seller. Since it's been more than 2 years since the incident (2021), we need to act quickly to file a complaint before the statute of limitations expires. Would you like to file a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum or State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission?

Human: I would like to send a legal notice. Can you help me draft it?

Bot: I can guide you through the process. To draft a legal notice, we'll need some more information. Can you please provide me with the following details:

1. Your full name and address
2. The full name and address of Venkatesh Engineering Works
3. The date of the incident (when you received the defective PTM)
4. A clear description of the defect and the amount you paid
5. The relief you are seeking (refund or replacement)

With this information, I can help you draft a legal notice.

Human: Sure. Mr. Sarvesh Kashinath Madgaonkar, S/o Late Kashinath Madgaonakar, Agriculturist by Occupation, 28 years old, resident of H no. 17/B, Ucassaim, Bardez, Goa- 403507.

Bot: Next, I need to know the full name and address of the opposite party, Venkatesh Engineering Works. Also, I need the exact details of the defective product, including the model number, serial number, and a brief description of the defects.

Human: The proprietor is Inderjeet. The address is Venkateshwara Engineering Works, Vishwatara Apartments, Near Hockey Stadium, Kolhapur, Maharashtra- 416012.

Bot: Also, please confirm the date of the incident, which you mentioned earlier as 10/08/2021, and the amount of Rs. 1,13,500 paid to Venkatesh Engineering Works. 

Once I have this information, I can help you draft a legal notice.

Human: Thank you. I want to file a consumer complaint; can you guide me?

Bot: To file a consumer complaint, you can approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) having jurisdiction over Kolhapur, Maharashtra. You can also contact the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (MSCDRC) or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) depending on the value of the dispute. 

You can also file a complaint online at the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/. Please note that you will need to attach the draft notice, payment receipt, invoice, and other relevant documents as evidence.

Additionally, you can contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or use the UMANG App for assistance with filing the complaint.

Human: I want a replacement of the power tilling machine, a refund of the entire amount of Rs. 1,13,500/- and compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for mental harassment.

Bot: You can file a complaint through the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/. This is an online platform provided by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, to file complaints. You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance in filing the complaint. Alternatively, you can approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, as the value of the goods is less than one crore rupees. Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing the complaint online?

Human: Yes, I want Litigation charges of Rs. 50,000/-.

Bot: You can claim the litigation charges as well. Now, I will help you draft the complaint. However, please note that the complaint should be filed in the district consumer forum having jurisdiction to hear the case. The jurisdiction is usually determined by the value of the goods or services and the place of residence or business of the parties. In your case, since the value of the goods is Rs. 1,13,500/-, the district consumer forum in Kolhapur will have jurisdiction. 

To draft the complaint, I need to know a few more details. Please provide me with the following information:

1. The date on which you received the defective power tilling machine.
2. The name and address of the witness who can testify on your behalf.
3. Any other relevant documents or evidence you have in support of your complaint.

Please provide me with this information, and I will help you draft the complaint.
