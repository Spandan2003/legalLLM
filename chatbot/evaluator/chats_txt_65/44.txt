Human: The water purifier sold to me was defective? What can I do now?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd be happy to help you with this issue.

To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the water purifier? Was it not filtering water properly, leaking, or something else?

Human: I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of Waves who is one of the authorized dealers of Streamz, the manufacturer of the water purifier, on 03/02/2022 and purchased a water purifier for a sum of Rs 8000/- Model Number: AX78945632 Capacity: 5 L The product was installed on 04/02/2022, and an e-receipt for the purchase was sent to my email ID on 03/02/2022. Within a few days, the purifier stopped working, and on 06/02/2022, I contacted the dealer to inform him about the issue. He said that a technician would be sent within a few days to assess the product.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details of your issue. It seems like you have a valid complaint regarding a defective product. 

Can you please tell me what happened next after you contacted the dealer on 06/02/2022? Did the technician visit and assess the product, or did you experience any further issues with the dealer?

Human: Yes, a technician came on 08/02/2022 to check the product. After a preliminary examination, he concluded that there was an irreparable defect in the product which could not be fixed, instead that the product would have to be replaced

Bot: So, the technician confirmed that the product was defective. Did the dealer or manufacturer replace the product with a new one, or did you have to take any further action?

Human: I asked him to take the purifier with him and get a new one installed as soon as possible

Bot: Did he follow up on replacing the product and installing a new one? If not, did you follow up with the dealer or the manufacturer?

Human: Not yet.

Bot: It's been more than 2 years since the issue occurred (2022-2024). Please note that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a 2-year time limit for filing a complaint. You might still have a chance to file a complaint, but you should do so as soon as possible.

Can you tell me more about the steps you've taken to get a replacement since the technician visited on 08/02/2022?

Human: I sent an email on 20/02/2022 to find out about the status of the request for replacement. The dealer simply stated that the matter was still under consideration and that the request would be processed within a few days.

Bot: It's been more than a year since you sent the email, and you still haven't received a replacement. This is beyond the 2-year time limit to file a consumer complaint. However, since you have a clear record of the events, you can still consider filing a complaint. Would you like to know the steps to file a complaint and draft a legal notice to the dealer?

Human: No on 21/02/2022, I registered my grievance in the customer feedback section hoping that the opposite party would reply at least to the grievance raised on the website. At this point, I also requested the seller to refund the money paid if the latter was not in a position to replace the product. After about three days, on 24/02/2022 (24th February, 2022), I received a call from the customer care team, but they only provided false promises as the product was not replaced within the 5 days mentioned by the latter.

Bot: That's frustrating. The incident occurred on 06/02/2022, which is within the 2-year time frame. Have you considered taking any legal action against the company or the dealer?

Human: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 02/03/2022, but I have not received any reply from them In my case, who is liable? Product manufacturer or Product seller?

Bot: Since you purchased the water purifier from an authorized dealer, the liability would likely fall on the product manufacturer, Streamz, under the Consumer Protection Act. However, the authorized dealer, Waves, may also be jointly and severally liable as they sold the defective product. We can consider taking action against both parties. 

Would you like to proceed with drafting a legal notice to both the manufacturer and the dealer?

Human: Noted. Thanks

Bot: Since you have already sent a notice, the next step would be to file a complaint with the Consumer Forum. You can use the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. Additionally, you can also use the e-daakhil portal to file your complaint. Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a complaint?

Human: Yes, I would like to

Bot: As per the Consumer Protection Act, you have two years from the date of the incident to file a complaint. Since your incident occurred on 04/02/2022, you are well within the time limit. 

Before we proceed, I want to confirm that you want to seek relief in the form of a replacement or a refund of the product. Is that correct?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos. My address is  20/918, III street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos – 100.

Bot: I can help you with the jurisdiction for filing the complaint. Based on your address, the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) for Cosmos would be the appropriate forum to file your complaint. However, to confirm, could you please tell me the value of the goods or services you are claiming for? This will help determine whether you should file in the District, State, or National Commission.

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you share a template that I could use for reference

Bot: Here's a template for a consumer complaint that you can use as a reference:
