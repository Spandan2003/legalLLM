Human: I paid a sum of money towards annual fees, but I am now unable to recover the money from the educational institution.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. Can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was there a dispute regarding the services promised by the institution or any other reason?

Human: My child is studying in a private school in the city of Cosmos. As part of the annual fees, I was asked to pay Rs 1,00,000. I paid the amount by way of cheque dated 06/03/2022, but now I have been transferred to another city so I want to withdraw from the admission process.

Bot: You paid the annual fees of Rs 1,00,000 to the school on 06/03/2022, but now you want to withdraw your child's admission and seek a refund. Can you please tell me the current date when you're planning to withdraw your child's admission?

Human: Partly yes. It was not mentioned that under no circumstances would the money be refunded.

Bot: So, the refund policy was not clearly mentioned as non-refundable. Did the school promise to provide any specific services or facilities as part of the annual fees that they have not delivered yet?

Human: Yes, but it was not helpful

Bot: You had paid the fees on 06/03/2022. Since today's date is 26/09/2024, the incident is more than 2 years old. Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, you have a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. You might want to consider taking action soon. 

Can you tell me more about the educational institution you paid the fees to? What is its name and location in the city of Cosmos?

Human: Yes, on 15/03/2022, I issued a legal notice to the institution for a refund of the money paid towards annual fees, and Rs 10,000/- as compensation for the mental distress caused, but they reiterated the terms and conditions of the refund policy.

Bot: You've already issued a legal notice. Since you paid the fees on 06/03/2022, you have a little over 2 years left to file a consumer complaint. Would you like to proceed with filing a formal complaint or explore other options?

Human: I visited the school campus on 02/03/2022 to discuss the matter. However, the officials categorically denied my request for fees refund. When I asked if at least a partial refund was possible given that the intimation regarding withdrawal from the admission process was done a good two months before the start of the academic year, I did not get a favorable response.

Bot: It seems like you've taken some steps to try to resolve the issue already. Since you mentioned you issued a legal notice on 15/03/2022, that means you have about 1 year and 6 months left to pursue legal action, considering the 2-year statute of limitations.

Considering the circumstances, would you like me to help you draft a legal notice to the institution or would you like to explore other options?

Human: Thanks, but I would like to know if I can get a refund in my case.

Bot: Considering you paid the fees on 06/03/2022 and your notice was issued on 15/03/2022, which is within a reasonable time frame, you may have a valid case for seeking a refund. However, the institution is not cooperating. 

Given the circumstances, it's recommended that you file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can guide you further on the process and help you draft a complaint.

Human: Yes, I would like to

Bot: You may consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (CDRC) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) depending on the jurisdiction and the value of the claim.

Before proceeding, I can help you draft a legal notice to the educational institution. Would you like me to assist you with that?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: Since the value of the fees paid is Rs. 1,00,000, which is less than one crore rupees, you can approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in the city of Cosmos. I can guide you on the process of filing a complaint. Would you like me to provide you with the draft of the complaint and notice?
