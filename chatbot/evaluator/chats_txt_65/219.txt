Human: Food served in my daughter’s marriage was of inferior quality. What can I do?

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.

To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to this inferior quality food being served at your daughter's marriage? Was it a catering service, a specific vendor, or a restaurant that you had hired for the event?

Human: I had booked a convention hall on 15.05.2015 belonging to Adulux Medicity and & Convention Centre Pvt Ltd for my daughter’s marriage scheduled on 30.08.2015.

Bot: The incident happened on 30.08.2015. You had booked the convention hall from Adulux Medicity and Convention Centre Pvt Ltd. The food served at the event was of inferior quality.

As the incident occurred more than 8 years ago, please note that the statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India is 2 years. You may not be eligible to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. However, you can still try to resolve the issue through a friendly settlement or approach the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) if they have jurisdiction.

If you'd like, I can guide you through the process of drafting a complaint or provide information on the SCDRC.

Human: Along with the convention hall, I had booked food services for 1200 guests, the cost of which was Rs.350 per plate. On the day of marriage, only 850 guests came. But even for them, the food was insufficient. Furthermore, the food served was of inferior quality. It was promised that first grade food will be served.

Bot: It seems like there was a discrepancy in the quantity and quality of food served. The incident occurred on 30.08.2015, which is more than 8 years ago. Unfortunately, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. You may not be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 for this incident. However, you can still consider approaching the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) or the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, if they have jurisdiction over the area where the incident occurred.

Can you please tell me if you have already approached Adulux Medicity and Convention Centre Pvt Ltd to resolve this issue?

Human: Yes.

Bot: You may approach the Adulux Medicity and Convention Centre Pvt Ltd directly and request a refund or compensation for the inconvenience caused. If you're not satisfied with their response, you can consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the District Consumer Forum, as the incident occurred in 2015, which is within the 2-year statute of limitations. 

Before proceeding, I can help you draft a notice to the Adulux Medicity and Convention Centre Pvt Ltd. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: I would like to claim Rs.5,00,000 as compensation.

Bot: You're seeking a total compensation of Rs. 5,00,000. Before we proceed, I would like to inform you that the incident occurred on 30.08.2015, which is more than 8 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years. However, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has extended this period to 3 years. Since the incident occurred before the amendment, the original 2-year period would still apply.

Considering this, you may still be eligible to file a complaint, but you should proceed with caution and consult a lawyer to confirm the feasibility of your case.

Now, would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to Adulux Medicity and Convention Centre Pvt Ltd, or would you like to file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum?

Human: I did. They are not receptive to any form of refund or compensation.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 30.08.2015, which is more than 8 years ago, you may face difficulties in pursuing legal action due to the statute of limitations (2 years in some cases, but for monetary claims, it's 3 years). However, you can still try to draft a legal notice to Adulux Medicity to see if they respond. Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice?

Human: Yes, please.

Bot: To draft a legal notice, I'll need some more information. Can you please provide me with the contact details of Adulux Medicity, specifically the name and designation of the person you dealt with, and their contact details? Also, please confirm if you have any supporting documents, such as the contract or invoice for the food services.

Human: My name is G.Padmakumar, S/o.Gopalakrishna Pillai, Girija Mandir, Thottaykkattukara, Aluva, Ernakulam District. The opposite party is Adulux Medicity & Convention Centre Pvt. Ltd. It has its office in Adulux Junction, Karukutty, N.H.47, Angamaly, Ernakulam District, Pin-683 576.

Bot: Based on the information provided, here's a draft of the legal notice:

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Deficiency in Service and Demand for Compensation

This is to bring to your notice that on 30.08.2015, I had booked your convention hall and catering services for my daughter's marriage at your premises.

We are demanding a compensation of Rs. 5,00,000/- for the said deficiency in service.
