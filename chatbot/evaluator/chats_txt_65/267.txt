Human: Hi, I had paid a photographer an advance for video and photography services for my son's marriage reception, but when I cancelled he did not refund the advance.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to the cancellation of the photography services? Was it due to any issues with the photographer or was it a mutual decision?

Human: I paid the advance of Rs. 15,000 to Mr. Shah through cheque no. 129998 dated 01/08/2018.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 01/08/2018, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years. As today's date is 26/09/2024, you are well within the time limit. 

Can you please tell me what efforts have you made so far to get your advance refunded from Mr. Shah?

Human: I informed him in October 2018 and requested a refund. He replied on Whatsapp with “no problem” but he never gave the money back

Bot: It seems like Mr. Shah has not returned your advance despite acknowledging your request for a refund. As the incident occurred in 2018, it's been more than 6 years. However, considering the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a 2-year statute of limitations for filing a complaint, you might still have time to pursue the matter.

Can you please tell me more about Mr. Shah - his contact details, address, or any other relevant information about him?

Human: I have a copy of the cancelled cheque as evidence of payment. I also have copies of WhatsApp messages and emails where I requested a refund after cancellation. Additionally, I sent a registered post letter to him on 13/08/2019 demanding the refund.

Bot: It seems you have a good record of your attempts to get a refund. Since the incident occurred in 2018 and you sent a registered post letter in 2019, it's almost 6 years ago. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. However, since you've made attempts to get a refund and have evidence, you can still try to recover your money through a consumer complaint.

Considering your desired relief is a refund of the advance amount, would you like to draft a legal notice to Mr. Shah to request the refund, or would you like to explore other options like filing a consumer complaint?

Human: What is that?

Bot: Mediation is a process where a neutral third-party helps you and the photographer, Mr. Shah, to resolve the dispute amicably. It's a less formal and less costly way to resolve the issue, and it can help you get your refund without going to court.

If you're interested in mediation, I can guide you through the process. However, if you're not satisfied with the outcome of mediation, we can explore other options, such as filing a complaint with the consumer forum.

Would you like to know more about mediation or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint?

Human: What are my other options?

Bot: You have several options. You can draft a legal notice to Mr. Shah, asking him to return the refund amount within a specified time frame. If he doesn't respond or return the amount, you can file a complaint with the Consumer Forum (District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum) under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The complaint can be filed within the statutory time limit of 2 years from the date of the incident. Since your incident occurred on 01/08/2018, you have already exceeded the 2-year time limit. However, I would advise you to consult a consumer rights lawyer to discuss your options and determine the best course of action.

Human: How do I go directly to court?

Bot: If you want to go directly to court, you can file a complaint in the Consumer Court. The court that has jurisdiction to hear your case depends on the amount involved. Since you paid Rs. 15,000, you can file a complaint in the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Gujarat. You will need to draft a complaint petition, which I can help you with, and file it in the court. You will also need to serve a notice to the opposite party, Mr. Shah, and he will have to respond to the notice. If he doesn't respond, the court will proceed with your complaint.

Human: Yes. Draft a legal notice for me.

Bot: Here's a draft notice:
