Human: I was cheated by an online platform.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.

To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to this cheating incident? What happened on the online platform that you feel was unfair or deceptive?

Human: Thank you. I had ordered a Sony Walkman on www.vlebazaar.in website on 09/03/2022 and paid Rs. 12,745 via my ICICI debit card. The order ID was 1461182.

Bot: Thank you for sharing the details. The incident occurred on 09/03/2022. You have 2 years from the date of the incident to file a complaint, and today's date is 26/09/2024, so you are well within the time frame.

Can you please tell me what happened after you placed the order? Did you receive the Sony Walkman, and if so, was it damaged or not as described?

Human: Yes, I have all the records ready. They promised 7 day delivery but I never received it.

Bot: It seems like the product was not delivered within the promised time frame. Can you please tell me if you have tried to contact the website or the seller (Vlebazaar.in) regarding this issue?

Human: On inquiring, I found out I had paid to a fraudulent account. So I cancelled the order on 29/04/2022 and requested a refund.

Bot: That's concerning. Did you receive any response or refund from the website regarding your cancellation and refund request?

Human: They said refund will be done by 13/07/2022 but I needed it urgently. So on 21/07/2022, I complained to ICICI Bank.

Bot: So, you've already involved ICICI Bank in the matter. Did ICICI Bank help you with the refund, or is there still an issue with the refund?

Human: The bank manager refunded Rs. 12,745 on 16/07/2022 calling it a "ghost credit" as it didn't reflect in my balance.

Bot: It seems like the bank took care of the refund. However, since the issue is with the online platform, let's focus on that. You've already complained to the platform on 21/07/2022, but they haven't taken any action. When did you last try to contact them about this issue?

Human: Yes, but the shocking part is, after getting this refund, the amount was re-transferred back to Vlebazaar's account without any authorization or OTP from me!

Bot: That's alarming. This suggests that the website might have been involved in fraudulent activities. Did you report this incident to the bank again or the police?

Human: Yes! I lost my hard earned money due to this scam. Please help me get it back.

Bot: I can sense your frustration. Given the timeline of events (the incident happened on 09/03/2022, and the refund was re-transferred on an unauthorized basis), we are well within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. 

Can you please provide me with the contact details of Vlebazaar, such as their customer care number or email ID?

Human: I prefer sending legal notice.

Bot: Sending a legal notice is a good first step. To draft a legal notice, I'll need some more information from you. Can you please provide the exact address of VLE Bazaar's registered office?

Human: Sure. My details are 1. Winston Souza Xavier, S/o S. Xavier, R/o 37/1C, Xell Bastora, Bardez, Goa. Opposite Party details are: 2. Mr. Himanshu Agarwal and Aman Agarwal, VLE Bazzar, Store address plot no. 4, Numberbad Marker, Grace Road, Sec 22, Gurgaon 1220022 Sec 28.

Bot: I have the details you provided. I will guide you through drafting a legal notice. To begin with, we need to draft a Memorandum of Parties. Here is a draft:
