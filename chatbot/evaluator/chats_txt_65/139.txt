Human: The item given for dry cleaning was misplaced. What do I do now?

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear that your item got misplaced. To help you with this issue, can you please tell me what led to the item getting misplaced? Was it an error on the part of the dry cleaner, or was it due to some other reason?

Human: On 09/12/2019, I went to a shop that provides dry-cleaning services, gave a saree, one kurta-pajama set, and one cotton shirt for dry-cleaning and the date for returning the dry-cleaned apparel was 13/12/2019. On 18/12/2019, the complainant received all the items except the saree. When enquired, I was nonchalantly informed that the item had been misplaced. Later, I was told the item got damaged during the dry-cleaning process, and that adequate compensation would be provided. However, I received only Rs 10,000 when the actual price of the product was Rs 18,000, so I refused to accept the sum of Rs 10,000 provided.

Bot: I understand your concern. You had given your saree, kurta-pajama set, and a cotton shirt for dry-cleaning on 09/12/2019, but only received the kurta-pajama set and the cotton shirt back on 18/12/2019, with the saree missing. You were initially told it was misplaced, and later informed that it got damaged during the dry-cleaning process. You were offered a compensation of Rs 10,000, but you refused it as it was not sufficient considering the saree's actual price of Rs 18,000.

Given that the incident occurred on 09/12/2019, it has been more than 2 years, and the statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India is 2 years. Would you like to pursue this matter further or are you looking for any soft remedies?

Human: I paid an amount of Rs 3000/- for the service. Branch visited: Jeevan Nagar

Bot: You're approaching the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint, which is September 26, 2024. Since the incident occurred on December 18, 2019, you have already exceeded the time limit. However, you can still try to negotiate a settlement with the dry-cleaning service or consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum if you're willing to seek a legal remedy.

Considering the circumstances, I would suggest you try to negotiate a settlement with the dry-cleaning service. You can write a polite letter to them explaining the issue and requesting compensation for the misplaced saree.

If you're interested in pursuing a legal remedy, I can guide you through the process of drafting a complaint and filing it with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum. Would you like me to help with that?

Human: Yes, sent many emails but received no favorable response

Bot: It seems like the company is not responding to your emails, and you're not getting a satisfactory resolution. The incident occurred on 18/12/2019, which is more than 2 years ago. Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since it's been over 2 years, you might need to consider other options.

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to the company, or would you like to explore other options?

Human: Yes, actually, it was only after sending a legal notice dated 22/06/2020 that the company came forward to pay a sum of Rs 10,000/- for the misplaced item.

Bot: Since the incident occurred on 09/12/2019 and you sent a legal notice on 22/06/2020, you have exceeded the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. However, you can still consider filing a complaint for the amount you are still owed, which is the difference between the value of the saree (Rs 18,000) and the amount you were paid (Rs 10,000). 

Would you like me to guide you through drafting a complaint or a legal notice for the remaining amount?

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: Considering the incident occurred on 18/12/2019 and the legal notice was sent on 22/06/2020, the complaint can still be filed. However, please note that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, has a time limit of 2 years from the date of the incident to file a complaint. Since this is within the time limit, you can proceed with filing a complaint.

Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from the company? Are you looking for compensation, replacement of the saree, or something else?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I'm not able to determine the city of Cosmos as it is not a well-known city in India. Could you please provide the name of your city or state? This will help me guide you on the next steps for filing a consumer complaint.

Human: Yes, it would be really helpful if you share a template that I could use for reference

Bot: Here's a template you can use as a reference to draft your consumer complaint:

**MEMORANDUM OF PARTIES**

The President, Cosmos District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission

**Name of the Complainant:** [Your Name]
**Address:** [Your Address]
**Contact Number:** [Your Phone Number]
**Email ID:** [Your Email ID]

**Name of the Opposite Party:** [Name of the Dry Cleaning Service Provider]
**Address:** [Address of the Dry Cleaning Service Provider]

**Complaint:**

That the opposite party provided dry cleaning services to the complainant on 09/12/2019, for which the complainant paid an amount of Rs. 3000/-. The complainant had handed over a saree, one kurta-pajama set, and one cotton shirt for dry cleaning, with a return date of 13/12/2019. However, on 18/12/2019, the complainant received all the items except the saree. When the complainant enquired about the missing item, the opposite party informed that it had been misplaced. Later, the opposite party claimed that the saree had been damaged during the dry cleaning process and offered a compensation of Rs. 10,000/-. However, the complainant refused to accept this amount as it was less than the actual value of the saree, which was Rs. 18,000/-. Despite sending several emails to the opposite party, they failed to provide a satisfactory response.

**Relief:**

The complainant seeks a compensation of Rs. 8,000/- (Rs. 18,000 - Rs. 10,000) for the loss suffered due to the opposite party's negligence and failure to provide the saree. The complainant also seeks a refund of the amount paid for the dry cleaning services, which is Rs. 3000/-.

**Evidence:**

The complainant attaches the following documents as evidence:

*   Original bill/invoice for the dry cleaning services
*   Photograph of the missing saree
*   Copies of emails sent to the opposite party
*   Original legal notice dated 22/06/2020
