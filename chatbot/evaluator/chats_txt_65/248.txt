Human: The land phone service has been irregular and non-functional since 2015. Further in 2020, the landline service provider removed the landline cable permanently.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.

To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to this problem? Was there any prior issue or dispute with the landline service provider that resulted in the permanent removal of the landline cable in 2020?

Human: Yes. Ever since 2015 I had made more than 50 complaints to them whenever the land line became non functional.

Bot: It's concerning that you've had to make multiple complaints without a satisfactory resolution. Given that the incident with the landline cable removal in 2020 is within the 2-year statute of limitations, we can proceed with seeking a remedy. However, the issue with the irregular and non-functional landline service from 2015 may not be actionable under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, as it's beyond the statute of limitations.

Would you like to focus on seeking a remedy for the 2020 incident, where the landline cable was removed permanently?

Human: Can you draft a legal notice for my case if I provide you the required details?

Bot: To draft a legal notice, I'll need some more information from you. Can you please provide the following details:

1. Your name and contact information (address and phone number)
2. The name and contact information (address and phone number) of the landline service provider
3. The specific promises made by the landline service provider regarding the service (if any)
4. The exact dates and details of the incidents where the landline service was non-functional
5. The relief you are seeking (e.g., reimbursement of fees, compensation for damages, etc.)

Once I have this information, I can help draft a legal notice for your case.

To,

The General Manager,

Subject: Unacceptable Service and Unlawful Disconnection of Landline Service

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Complaint of K.K. George, Kaithavayalil House, Kappadu P.O, Kanjirappally, Kottayam District-686508.

I, K.K. George, hereby serve this notice upon you, as the General Manager of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, to bring to your attention the persistent and unacceptable service issues I have been facing with my landline connection at my residence, Kaithavayalil House, Kappadu P.O, Kanjirappally, Kottayam District-686508.

Despite numerous complaints made to your office since 2015, the landline service has been irregular and non-functional. Furthermore, in 2020, your company permanently removed the landline cable, leaving me without any service.

I have made over 50 complaints to your office regarding this issue, but unfortunately, no satisfactory resolution has been provided. I request that you take immediate action to rectify this situation and restore my landline service at the earliest. If not, I will be forced to take further action under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.

I request you to take the following actions:

1. Restore my landline service at the earliest.
2. Provide compensation for the inconvenience and distress caused due to the non-functional service.
3. Take necessary steps to prevent such incidents in the future.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response within 15 days from the date of this notice, I will be forced to approach the Consumer Forum for redressal.

Please acknowledge receipt of this notice.

Yours faithfully,

K.K. George

Please review and confirm if this is acceptable to you. I can make any necessary changes before finalizing the draft.

Human: I am  a senior citizen availing the land phone services of the opposite parties bearing land line No.04828-236465 for more than 30 years. For the last 10 years the land line service offered by the opposite party has been irregular and land phone remain the non functional since 2015. However, the opposite party was regular in issuing bills. Ever since 2015 I had made more than 50 complaints to the party whenever the land line became non functional. On each complaint technical staff of the opposite party resolved the issue and the same was repeated. While so on 24.04.2020 a big tree fell on the Kalaketty – Kappadu main road and BSNL landline cables were damaged. I got reliable information that the opposite party removed the land line cables permanently and were not replaced. This is an arbitrary action of the opposite party without giving any notice to me. The land line remained non-functional since 24.04.2020. Despite the fact that the land line was non-functional they kept on sending bills regularly. Me being a senior citizen, who depends on the land line mode of telecommunication for getting connected with his children, grand children and other relatives, is put to irreparable hardship due to the above said act of the opposite party.

Bot: Thank you for providing the necessary details. I can now help you draft a legal notice to the opposite party, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. Here's a draft notice:

Dear Sir,

Re: Non-Functional Landline Service - Landline No. 04828-236465

I, K.K. George, a senior citizen and a loyal customer of your esteemed organization, am writing to bring to your notice the non-functional state of my landline service, bearing No. 04828-236465, which has been continuing for over 9 years since 2015. Despite numerous complaints made to your technical staff, the issue has not been resolved, and the service has been rendered non-functional.

Further, on 24.04.2020, a tree fell on the Kalaketty-Kappadu main road, damaging the BSNL landline cables. I was informed that your company removed the landline cables permanently without giving any notice to me, leaving my service non-functional. Despite this, your company has continued to send bills regularly, causing me immense hardship and financial loss.

As a senior citizen, I rely heavily on my landline service to stay connected with my family and relatives. The non-functional service has caused me irreparable hardship, and I request you to take immediate action to restore my landline service.

I demand that you take the following steps:

1. Restore my landline service at the earliest.
2. Compensate me for the loss and hardship suffered due to the non-functional service.
3. Refund the bills sent to me during the period of non-functionality.
