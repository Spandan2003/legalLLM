Human: I was cheated by a tourist agency

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. Can you please tell me more about what happened? What led to the cheating by the tourist agency? Was it related to a tour package, booking, or something else?

Human: Yes, my husband and I booked our ‘Magical Kenya & Tanzania' package (booking no. 8787 dated 10/09/2018) for our honeymoon offered by M/s Trail Blazer Tours Pvt Ltd. The total package cost was Rs. 5,98,600 for visiting places in Kenya and Tanzania and accordingly we paid the entire amount.

Bot: That sounds like a distressing experience. Can you please tell me what specifically happened after you booked the package that led to you feeling cheated? For example, were you not provided with the promised services, or were there any discrepancies in the itinerary? 

Also, please note that since the incident occurred on 10/09/2018, it's been more than 2 years. The statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. You may still be able to file a complaint, but it's essential to act quickly.

Human: Yes, I have all the documents. But there were major issues right from flight ticket booking.

Bot: It seems that the incident occurred more than 2 years ago (2018). Please note that the Consumer Protection Act has a 2-year statute of limitations for filing complaints. If you haven't filed a complaint yet, you may not be eligible to pursue legal action. However, you can still try to resolve the issue through a settlement or a complaint to the National Consumer Helpline.

Can you please tell me what were the major issues you faced with the flight ticket booking and the rest of the package?

Human: Due to their negligence in booking, we had to pay Rs. 1,04,280 extra to rebook flight tickets. Also, they suddenly changed the tour itinerary after we landed there, without even informing us!

Bot: That sounds frustrating. Did you inform the agency about the issues and ask for a refund or compensation for the extra charges and changes in the itinerary?

Human: The hotel accommodation provided was far inferior to what was agreed in the itinerary. During a jungle safari, the vehicle broke down halfway leaving us stranded. It was a life threatening experience!

Bot: That sounds terrifying. Did you report these issues to the tourist agency, M/s Trail Blazer Tours Pvt Ltd, at the time of the incident or after you returned?

Human: Yes, the food quality at various accommodation camps was terrible. And finally, they dropped us at the airport 7 hours before departure! It was a nightmare trip.

Bot: It sounds like you had a very poor experience with Trail Blazer Tours Pvt Ltd. This is a serious case of deficiency in service. Did you try to resolve the issue with the company after returning to India?

Human: The experience became hell when we were dropped at the airport 7 hours in advance before flight departure time. Poor quality of food served at accommodation camps.

Bot: The experience sounds like a nightmare. Did you file a complaint with the tour operator, M/s Trail Blazer Tours Pvt Ltd, after returning from the trip?

Human: I will go for a complaint.

Bot: Before filing a complaint, let's ensure you have all the necessary documents ready. You've already mentioned that you have the booking invoice, itinerary, and other relevant documents. Additionally, you may want to gather any other evidence that supports your claims, such as receipts for the extra payment made for rebooking flights, photos or videos of the substandard hotel accommodations and food, and any communication with the tour operator regarding the issues you faced.

To proceed, I can help you draft a complaint. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: Sure. My details are Mrs. Ranjana Ferrao Corderio  R/o Flat No. S-3, Building No. 6 Kamat Complex, Caranzalem, Goa. I am a professional chef

Bot: I've noted down your details. Since the incident occurred in 2018, please note that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. As the incident occurred in 2018, you have already exceeded the 2-year limit. However, you can still try to file a complaint, but it might not be entertained by the consumer court. Would you like to know the process of filing a complaint despite the time limit?

Human: M/s Trail Blazer Tours Pvt Ltd, 201 & 204, 2nd Floor Gera’s Imperium II Patto Plaza, Panaji Goa – 403001

Bot: Now, I would like to know what relief are you seeking from the company? Are you looking for a refund of the entire amount, compensation for the trouble you faced, or something else?

Human: I would want a refund of the entire amount of Rs. 17,00,000/- and compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for mental harassment, as well as litigation charges of Rs. 50,000/-

Bot: You can draft a complaint and send a notice to the company. I can help you draft a sample complaint. The complaint should include your details, the company's details, the incident details, and the relief you are seeking. 

Here is a sample draft:
