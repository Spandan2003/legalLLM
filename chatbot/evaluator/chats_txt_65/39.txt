Human: I placed an order for an oven from a home appliances company but didn’t receive the product.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you with this issue. Can you please tell me more about what happened? What led to this situation - did you not receive any communication from the company, or did they not deliver the product as scheduled?

Human: I purchased the product from ABC Home Appliances Private Limited on 05/03/2022. I was told that the product would be delivered within 5 working days from the date of purchase, but it has been over 15 days now, but I have not received it yet.

Bot: The incident occurred on 05/03/2022, which is more than 2 years ago. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. This means that you may not be eligible to file a complaint with the consumer court for this issue.

However, I can still try to help you with some soft remedies or alternatives. Can you tell me if you have tried contacting the company's customer service or sales team to inquire about the status of your order? Have you received any communication from them regarding the delay or the delivery of the product?

Human: Made a down payment of the purchase cost  by way of NEFT (Transaction ID: 12456783) on 05/03/2022; received an e-receipt on 06/02/2022 by way of email

Bot: It seems like there might be a discrepancy in the dates you provided. You mentioned you made a down payment on 05/03/2022, but you received an e-receipt on 06/02/2022. Could you clarify this for me?

Also, have you tried contacting the company, ABC Home Appliances Private Limited, to inquire about the status of your order?

Human: I paid Rs 30,000 for it.

Bot: You paid Rs 30,000 as a down payment on 05/03/2022. Since it's been over 15 days since the delivery date promised by the company, have you tried contacting the company's customer care or customer service department to report the issue and ask about the status of your order?

Human: No, I made a down payment of the entire cost of the product.

Bot: You made a down payment of Rs 30,000 on 05/03/2022, and the product was supposed to be delivered within 5 working days from the date of purchase. However, it has been over 15 days, and you still haven't received the product. This seems to be a clear case of delayed delivery of goods.

Considering the incident occurred on 05/03/2022, which is more than 2 years ago, the statute of limitations for filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, has already expired. However, you can still try to resolve the issue through a complaint to the company or consumer forum, but it will be considered as a time-barred complaint.

Would you like to draft a legal notice to the company or explore other options?

Human: Yes. On 10/03/2022, I sent a reminder to the seller, but there was no response to the email sent. Then, on 15/03/2022, I raised the issue with the customer care division of the company. I was told that the matter would be resolved within two working days, but I have still not received the product. On 24/03/2022, I received a call from the customer support team, this time only to inform that the matter would be closed. When I pointed out that I had still not received the product, they simply stated that they would escalate the issue to the relevant persons for looking into the issue.

Bot: It seems like the seller is not responding to your queries and is not taking any concrete steps to resolve the issue. The fact that they are closing the case without delivering the product is also not acceptable.

Considering the incident occurred on 05/03/2022, you have over 2 years to file a complaint. However, since you have been trying to resolve this issue since 10/03/2022, I would recommend that you file a complaint as soon as possible.

Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice to the seller or would you like to file a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App?

Human: Yes, I sent a legal notice dated 20/03/2022 but it went in vain. I did not receive a reply from the company.

Bot: The incident occurred on 05/03/2022, which is more than 2 years ago. However, considering you have already taken steps to resolve the issue, I would recommend that you consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for immediate assistance. You can also visit the e-daakhil portal to file a consumer case. Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a complaint or a legal notice?

Human: Yes, I would like to.

Bot: Before we proceed, I would like to inform you that the incident occurred on 05/03/2022, and it's been more than 2 years. You may want to note that the Consumer Protection Act has a 2-year statute of limitations for filing complaints. However, we can still try to move forward with the complaint.

To draft a complaint, we would need to provide details such as the opposing party's name (ABC Home Appliances Private Limited), your details, and the relief you are seeking. Would you like me to guide you through drafting a complaint or would you like to file a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance?

Human: I live in the city of Cosmos

Bot: I'm not aware of a city called "Cosmos" in India. Could you please provide the name of the state or district where you reside? This will help me guide you on how to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum. 

Also, I would like to remind you that the incident occurred on 05/03/2022, and it's now 26/09/2024, so you have filed your complaint within the statutory time limit of 2 years. 

If you provide the correct location, I can help you with the next steps.
