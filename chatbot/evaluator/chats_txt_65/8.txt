Human: I have an issue regarding my late husband's insurance policy with Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your issue.

Can you please tell me what led to the issue with your late husband's insurance policy with Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd.? What specifically is the problem you're facing?

Human: Certainly. My husband was approached by an agent from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd. on 20th February 2020, who convinced him to buy a health insurance policy. After some discussions, my husband agreed, and on 2nd March 2020, the agent collected Rs. 2,00,000 from us and issued the policy.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. It seems like there might be a dispute regarding the insurance policy.

Can you please tell me what happened next? Did your husband receive the policy documents, and was the policy ever activated? And also, did you or your husband receive any communication from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd. regarding the policy after the payment was made?

Human: : Yes, we have the policy document.

Bot: That's good to know. Can you tell me what happened next? Did your husband make any claims under the policy, or was there an issue with the policy itself?

Human: My husband fell ill and was admitted to Apollo Hospital with Covid-19 pneumonia on 13th September 2020, we informed the insurance company about the situation and requested a claim form.

Bot: It seems like a serious situation. Did the insurance company respond to your request for a claim form, and did you submit the form and required documents to them?

Human: No, unfortunately, they didn't respond to our request.

Bot: That's concerning. Did you follow up with them multiple times, and if so, what was their response?

Human: : We wrote a letter to the insurance company on 15th March 2021, asking them to settle the claim, but still received no response.

Bot: It seems that the insurance company did not respond to your initial request and then to your follow-up letter. Did you receive any response or resolution to your claim after that?

Human: Yes, we sent a registered legal notice to the company on 14th December 2021, but once again, they did not reply.

Bot: It seems like the insurance company has not responded to your efforts to resolve the issue. 

Considering the timeline of events, I want to inform you that the incident occurred on 13th September 2020, and you have been trying to resolve the issue since then. However, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has a time limit of 2 years for filing a complaint. Since the incident occurred in 2020, you are within the time limit.

Would you like to pursue legal action against the insurance company, or would you like to try to resolve the issue through other means?

Human: We didn't receive any response to our letters or legal notice. However, upon checking my father's bank statement, we noticed that the insurance company had transferred only Rs. 2,00,000 to his account on 29th December 2020, which is far less than the insured amount of Rs. 20,00,000.

Bot: It seems that the insurance company has made a partial payment, but not the full amount. This is concerning. Did you or your husband pass away due to the illness, and if so, when?

Human: I would like to seek the full claim of insurance, Rs.18,00,000 along with interest @ 12% p.a., after deduction of the Rs.2,00,000 deposited in the account. I would like to seek an additional compensation of Rs. 3,00,000.

Bot: I understand your concerns and desired relief. Since the incident occurred in 2020, I would like to bring to your notice that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. As the incident occurred in September 2020, you would have had to file the complaint by September 2022.

However, considering the circumstances, I can help you draft a legal notice to the insurance company, seeking the remaining claim amount, interest, and compensation.

Would you like me to provide you with a draft of the legal notice?

Also, I would like to inform you that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process and provide further support.

Human: In that case, I would like to seek Rs.35,000 as costs.

Bot: So, you are seeking a total relief of Rs. 18,00,000 (claim amount) + Rs. 3,00,000 (additional compensation) + Rs. 35,000 (costs) = Rs. 21,35,000. 

Considering the time taken to resolve this issue, I would advise you to consider filing a consumer complaint. 

Before we proceed, I would like to inform you that the incident occurred in 2020, and you are approaching me in 2024, which is beyond the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. However, you can still consider filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, Section 24, which provides for a time limit of 3 years from the date of the cause of action.

Would you like me to assist you in drafting a complaint to be filed with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum?
