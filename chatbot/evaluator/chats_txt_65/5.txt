Human: I've been trying to retrieve the maturity amount from a fixed deposit I made with Sahara Credit Co-Operative Society Ltd. How do I resolve it.

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better assist you, can you please provide more details about the issue? 

What led to the issue with retrieving your maturity amount? Was it due to a delay, or were you unable to get a response from the society?

Human: Certainly. I decided to deposit some money into a fixed deposit scheme after consulting with one of their staff members. So, on 30th March 2019, I deposited Rs. 4,98,000 for a period of 18 months. They have issued a  Fixed Deposit bond bearing Certificate for the same  on 30/09/2019.

Bot: The deposit was made on 30th March 2019, and the Fixed Deposit bond was issued on 30th September 2019. Can you please tell me when you think the 18-month period would have ended? Also, have you received any communication from Sahara Credit Co-Operative Society Ltd regarding the maturity of your deposit?

Human: The fixed deposit matured on 30th September 2020, and the maturity amount was supposed to be Rs. 5,71,206  which the co-operative society has failed to pay despite several attempts on  my part to collect it.

Bot: It's been more than 2 years since the maturity date, so unfortunately, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. However, I would recommend still taking action to recover your amount.

Could you please tell me the contact details of the staff member or the official who issued the fixed deposit bond, or any other relevant contact information for Sahara Credit Co-Operative Society Ltd?

Human: No, unfortunately, the Co-Operative Society has failed to pay the maturity amount despite several attempts on my part to collect it.

Bot: It seems like the issue is with non-payment of the maturity amount. Considering that the incident occurred on September 30, 2020, and you're still trying to collect the amount, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years. Since it's been more than 2 years, it might be challenging to pursue legal action.

However, you can still try to contact the co-operative society to resolve the issue amicably. If that doesn't work, you can consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for assistance.

Additionally, you may want to check with the State Cooperative Department or the Registrar of Cooperative Societies in your state to see if they can provide any guidance or assistance in resolving this matter.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Human: I personally visited their office multiple times to inquire about the payment, but they always came up with various technical excuses and didn't pay me. I do not remember the dates of all the time

Bot: Since the incident is over 2 years old (as of 2024), you might face difficulties in filing a case. However, I would still advise you to proceed with caution. 

You mentioned that the fixed deposit matured on 30th September 2020, and the co-operative society has failed to pay the maturity amount of Rs. 5,71,206. 

Can you please tell me the name and contact details of the person you dealt with at the co-operative society?

Human: Yes, I sent them a notice on 12th March 2021 demanding the payment of the maturity amount, but it was returned unserved.

Bot: It seems like the issue has been ongoing for a while. Since the incident occurred more than 2 years ago, please note that you may face challenges in pursuing legal action due to the statute of limitations. However, we can still explore other options.

Have you considered approaching the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance?

Human: What all possible remedies can I get.

Bot: Considering the Co-Operative Society has failed to pay the maturity amount despite your attempts to collect it, you have several options:

1.  You can approach the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (NCDRC) or the State Commission, depending on the jurisdiction, to file a complaint against Sahara Credit Co-Operative Society Ltd. for not paying the maturity amount.
2.  You can also approach the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to report the matter and seek their assistance in recovering the amount.
3.  If the Co-Operative Society is still operational, you can try to negotiate with them directly to settle the matter amicably.

If you are looking for a legal remedy, I can help you draft a legal notice to the Co-Operative Society.

Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance.

Would you like me to draft a legal notice for you?

Human: Ok. Is it possible I can seek all of the remedies mentioned above.

Bot: Yes, you can seek all of the remedies mentioned. Before pursuing litigation, let's try to resolve the issue through a formal notice. I can help you draft a notice to the Sahara Credit Co-Operative Society Ltd, demanding the payment of the maturity amount, along with interest and compensation for the delay.

Would you like me to provide you with a draft of the notice?

Human: I would like to retrieve the FD matured amount of Rs.5,71,206 along with interest of 14.5% p.a. from 30/09/2020 to till date. Along with this I would like to seek a total of Rs. 30,000 as compensation and costs.

Bot: I've noted down the details. Since it's been more than 2 years since the maturity date (30th September 2020), we need to consider the limitation period for filing a consumer complaint.

As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the limitation period for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the cause of action. In your case, the cause of action is the failure to pay the maturity amount, which occurred on 30th September 2020. Since it's been more than 2 years, we may face some challenges in filing a new complaint.

However, we can still try to draft a legal notice to the co-operative society, demanding the payment of the maturity amount along with interest, compensation, and costs. This notice can be served to them, and if they fail to respond or make the payment, we can consider filing a consumer complaint.

Would you like me to help you draft a legal notice?

Human: Could you provide me the helpline number

Bot: You can call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or 1915 for immediate assistance. Additionally, you can also visit the website https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/ to register your complaint online. If you need a state-specific helpline number, I can provide you with that as well.

Bot: You can contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or 1915. Additionally, you can also use the UMANG App for assistance. If you need a state-specific helpline number, I can provide you with that as well.
