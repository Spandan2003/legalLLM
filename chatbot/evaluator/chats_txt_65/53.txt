Human: I have faced problem with SpiceJet Airline

Bot: Thank you for sharing your concern. Can you please tell me what happened with SpiceJet Airline? What led to the issue?

Human: Yes, on 12/02/2021 I had booked air tickets from Goa to Delhi for 4 passengers via Spicejet website. The PNR number was 28283855 and I paid Rs. 5,000 for the booking.

Bot: It seems like the incident occurred on 12/02/2021, which is more than 2 years ago. As per the Consumer Protection Act, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. I would advise you to take action as soon as possible to avoid missing the deadline.

Can you please tell me what specifically went wrong with your SpiceJet booking? Was it a cancellation, delay, or something else?

Human: Yes, I have taken printouts of the booking confirmation email and payment receipt.

Bot: Thank you for having the necessary documents. 

You mentioned that the incident occurred on 12/02/2021. As per the Consumer Protection Act, the statute of limitations for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since your incident occurred on 12/02/2021, you are still within the time frame to file a complaint. 

Can you please tell me what exactly happened on 12/02/2021 that led to the issue with SpiceJet Airlines? Was there a cancellation, delay, or any other problem?

Human: Shockingly, the airline cancelled all the tickets without any intimation or consent from my side. I got to know only when I called to reconfirm.

Bot: That's unacceptable. Did you try to contact SpiceJet to get a refund or rebook the tickets after they cancelled them?

Human: No, the customer care had no clue and gave no explanation on why the booked tickets were cancelled unilaterally. This caused immense harassment to me and my family.

Bot: That must have been frustrating. Did you ask them to refund the amount you paid for the tickets, Rs. 5,000?

Human: The travel date booked was 25th February 2021. I got the cancellation news just 2 days before travel.

Bot: That's even more frustrating, especially when it's just 2 days before the travel date. Did you try to contact the airline again to see if they would reinstate the tickets or offer any compensation?

Human: This last minute cancellation led to huge financial losses as I had to book fresh tickets at higher cost. I am seeking a refund of Rs. 5,000 for the booking amount, along with ₹20,000 as compensation for harassment and additional expenses incurred.

Bot: Considering the incident occurred on 12/02/2021, the Consumer Protection Act's 2-year statute of limitations has not expired. However, it's still a good idea to act quickly to file a complaint. 

Since you've already incurred additional expenses and experienced harassment, you may want to consider filing a consumer complaint. I can help you draft a legal notice to send to SpiceJet. Would you like me to guide you through that process?

Human: I prefer sending legal notice.

Bot: I can help you draft a legal notice. To do that, I'll need some more information. Can you please provide me with the address of SpiceJet Airlines' registered office, and also the name and designation of the person to whom the notice should be addressed?

Human: Sure. My details are Ameya Gurudas Naik, Aged about 34 years, R/o H no.12, Chinchwada, Chimbel, Tiswadi,- Goa- 403006 and I am a professional Boxer.

Bot: Thank you for providing your details. Based on the information you provided, I can draft a legal notice for you. However, before I do that, I would like to inform you that you have two years from the date of the incident to file a complaint. Since your incident occurred on 12/02/2021, you still have time to file a complaint. 

Here is a draft of the legal notice that I can provide you:
