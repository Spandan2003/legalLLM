Human: Hi, I have a problem with a sports club I joined. I paid them a membership fee, but they have not provided the promised services and neither are they refunding my money.

Bot: Sorry to hear that you're facing this issue with the sports club. Can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was there a specific incident or a series of events that made you realize they weren't providing the promised services?

Human: I joined the Baroda Presidency Sports Club as a Gold Member by paying Rs. 25,000 as the membership fee. The club representative promised me that I wouldn't have to pay any annual maintenance charges, but I had to pay 7,500 per month as additional charges. No one collected the cheque I had made out for this amount. When I asked for a refund of the 25,000, they refused.

Bot: It seems like the club representative made false assurances about the additional charges and failed to collect the cheque for the same. They are also not refunding the membership fee as promised.

Can you please tell me when did you paid the membership fee of Rs. 25,000 and when did you first notice that the club is not providing the promised services and not refunding your money?

Human: I paid through a cheque on 12/09/2017

Bot: You paid the membership fee through a cheque on 12th September 2017. Since today's date is 26th September 2024, the incident is more than 7 years old. Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the limitation period for filing a consumer complaint is 2 years from the date of the cause of action. You may still be able to file a complaint, but it's essential to consult a lawyer or a consumer rights expert to understand your options.

Can you please provide me with the details of the Baroda Presidency Sports Club, such as their address or contact information?

Human: No. I want to take this directly to Court

Bot: Considering that you paid the membership fee in 2017, you may be running out of time to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The Act has a 2-year statute of limitations for filing complaints. Since your incident occurred in 2017, you may need to check if you can still file a complaint or explore other legal options.

I can guide you on drafting a legal notice to the sports club, which is the first step in initiating legal proceedings. Would you like me to assist with that?

Human: Yes

Bot: To draft a notice, I'll need some more information from you. Can you please provide me with the following details:

1. Your full name and address
2. The name and address of the Baroda Presidency Sports Club
3. The exact details of the cheque you paid (date, cheque number, etc.)
4. The specific promises made by the club that they failed to fulfill
5. The exact amount you are seeking as a refund or compensation

Once I have this information, I can help you draft a notice.

Human: I am Jagrut Nagrik, a Voluntary Consumer Association. The association is located opposite to LBS Vidhyalay, Nr. Prerna School, Sangam Karelibaug Rd., Vadodara. I want to file the complaint along with Maulik Joitendrabhai Shah, who lives in D-52, Navnit Park Society, Harni Varasia Ring road, Vadodara - 390006. Baroda Presidency Sports Club is located in Sherkhi, Neat to Podar World School, Gotri- Sevasi Road, Vadodara - 390007.

Bot: Based on the information you've provided, I'll draft a sample notice that you can use as a template. However, please note that this is just a sample and you may need to modify it according to your specific needs and the laws of your jurisdiction.
