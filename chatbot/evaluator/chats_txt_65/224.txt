Human: I lost my cable connection due to which I couldn’t watch the entire FIFA World Cup. What remedy do I have?

Bot: Sorry to hear that you missed the FIFA World Cup due to a cable connection issue. 

To better understand your situation, could you please tell me what led to the loss of your cable connection? Was it due to a fault on the cable operator's side, a technical issue, or something else?

Human: I subscribed to the cable service for two years (July 2016 - Oct 2018) and made timely payments. However, from June 16th, 2018, I lost the cable connection. Despite contacting the cable service provider 14 times and receiving a complaint number, the issue wasn't resolved for over 10 days. I missed the FIFA World Cup and am still facing continued service disruption. So, I got a new connection elsewhere for Rs. 4,000.

Bot: It seems like you've been experiencing a prolonged issue with your cable service. Since the incident occurred in 2018, which is more than 2 years ago, please note that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. However, I can still guide you on the possible steps you can take.

Can you please provide more information about the cable service provider you were subscribed to at that time? Their name and contact details would be helpful in understanding the situation better.

Human: I want a full refund of Rs. 3,840 for the unused portion of the cable connection and Rs. 4,000 for the new connection. I also want Rs. 10,000 as compensation for the mental agony suffered.

Bot: I can help you draft a complaint. Before that, I would like to inform you that you have two years from the date of the incident to file a complaint, as per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Since your incident occurred on June 16, 2018, you have already filed your complaint within the time limit.

To proceed, I need to know more about the cable service provider. Can you please provide me with the name of the cable service provider you were subscribed to?

Human: Yes, please.

DEFENDANT  COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019  TO, THE PRESIDENT, CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL FORUM, ERNAKULAM  SIR, THIS COMPLAINT IS FILED UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019 AGAINST THE DEFENDANT COMPANY FOR DEFICIENCY IN CABLE TV SERVICES.

I had availed cable TV connection from the defendant company and made yearly payments of Rs. 3,540/- for the period from July 2016 to August 2017 and Rs. 3,840/- for the period from September 2017 to October 2018. 2. The said cable TV services have been suffering from the following defects: i) From 16/06/2018 onwards, I have not been able to receive the cable TV connection, and despite contacting the defendant company nearly 14 times, the only response received was “you are on queue.” ii) Although I had contacted the defendant company as I was unable to watch the FIFA World Cup matches, the defendant company failed to rectify the issue promptly. iii) On 21/06/2018, I received a message from the defendant company that complaint No. GA06181779 has been registered, but there was no further response or action taken to resolve the issue. iv) On 30/06/2018, I received another message from the defendant company stating that my complaint has been registered, despite the fact that it had been over 10 days since my initial complaint about the defective cable TV services. 3.

RELIEF SOUGHT: 1. I pray that this Hon’ble Forum may be pleased to pass an order directing the defendant company to refund the amount of Rs. 7,840/- (Rs. 3,840/- for the yearly payment made to the defendant company and Rs. 4,000/- paid to the new cable TV provider); 2. I pray that this Hon’ble Forum may be pleased to direct the defendant company to pay compensation of Rs. 10,000/- for the mental agony and hardships suffered due to the defendant company’s negligence; 3. I pray that this Hon’ble Forum may be pleased to direct the defendant company to pay a sum of Rs. 10,000/- towards the cost of these proceedings.  VERIFICATION  I, SUNIL CHAMMANY S/O C.X.
