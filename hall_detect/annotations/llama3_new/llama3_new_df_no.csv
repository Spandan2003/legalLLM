Subject: Complaint regarding misleading advertisement and requested features
Dear Sir/Madam,
Re: Subscription to Software Suite
I am writing to bring to your attention a grievance regarding my subscription to your software suite, which I purchased on [Date of Purchase]. The advertisement on your website and social media platforms led me to believe that the software suite included advanced data analytics tools. However, upon activation, I found that these features are only available in a higher-tier plan.
I would like to request that you either provide me with the promised features or provide a full refund of the amount paid. I have attached a copy of my purchase receipt for your reference.
I would appreciate a prompt response regarding this matter. If I do not hear from you within the next 7-10 days, I will be forced to explore further action to protect my consumer rights.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Once you've reviewed and modified the letter, I can guide you on the next steps, including filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline or the e-daakhil portal if needed.","{1: {'context': ""\nDocument 0:\nretailer claims that he is offering a special discount on his goods as part of a festival celebration, while he is actually using the festival as an excuse to get rid of old and outdated goods, then he is deceiving consumers.

If he fails to do that, then he is making an unsubstantiated claim or a false statement. If an advertisement for a face cream claims that it removes dark spots on the face and even prevents them from coming back, the manufacturer should be able to prove this.

Human: i purchased a vape and it burned me. what remedy do i have?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the vape? Was it a manufacturing defect, a faulty product, or something else?


Human: im not sure. i inhaled from it and it became burning hot and burnt my mouth


AI: It sounds like you experienced a severe reaction to the vape. 


To initiate a product liability action under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you'll need to demonstrate that the harm resulted from a ""defective product."" In this case, it seems that the vape might have been defective or malfunctioned.


Can you please tell me when this incident occurred? Please provide me with the date or an approximate date when you inhaled from the vape and experienced the burning sensation.


Human: it occurred yesterday


AI: So, the incident occurred on 2024-09-29, which is within the two-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India.


Since the incident is relatively recent, you can consider taking legal action to seek compensation for the harm you suffered.


Before proceeding, can you please tell me about the vape you purchased? Do you have the product details, such as the brand name, model number, or any other relevant information?


Human: it was a Raya vape


AI: So, the vape that caused the harm was a Raya vape.


Since you're looking to take legal action, I can guide you on the next steps. However, before that, I'd like to know more about the desired relief. What are you seeking from the Raya vape manufacturer or the dealer from whom you purchased the product?


Are you looking for compensation for medical expenses, damage to property (if any), or something else?


Human: im looking for a replacement with a functional vape


AI: You're looking for a replacement for the defective Raya vape with a functional one.


Before moving forward, I would like to inform you that you have the option to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance. You can also check the location-based helpline number for your state.


However, if you wish to pursue a complaint through the consumer courts, I can help you draft a notice to the Raya vape manufacturer or the dealer. This notice will outline the incident, the harm caused, and the desired relief.


Would you like me to assist you in drafting a notice for the Raya vape manufacturer or the dealer?

"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: hi


AI: It seems like you've initiated a conversation, but you haven't shared a specific consumer grievance. Could you please tell me about the issue you're facing in a particular sector, such as Airlines, Automobile, Banking, or any other? This will help me assist you better.


Human: i purchased a second hand fridge from a seller on ebay. it was delivered to me yesterday but its not working. the seller is unreachable


AI: Thank you for sharing this concern with me. I'm here to help.


That sounds frustrating, especially when the seller is unreachable. Can you please tell me what led to the issue with the fridge not working? Was it immediately apparent when you unpacked it, or did it start malfunctioning after a short period of use?


Human: it did not switch on


AI: The fact that the fridge did not switch on immediately suggests that there might be a more serious issue. 


You mentioned that the seller is unreachable. That's a problem. 


Can you please tell me when did you purchase this fridge and when did you notice this issue, specifically?


Human: i purchased it 2 weeks ago and it was delivered to me yesterday. i tried to set it up but it did not switch on


AI: It seems like you purchased the fridge 2 weeks ago, but the issue only became apparent when it was delivered to you yesterday.


As per the Consumer Protection Act in India, the time limit to file a complaint is generally 2 years from the date of purchase. Since you purchased the fridge 2 weeks ago, you're still within this time limit.


Can you please tell me if you have any communication with the seller, such as an email or a message on eBay, that you can share with me? This might be helpful in drafting a complaint if needed.


Human: i texted and called the seller multiple times informing them of the issue, but no response


AI: It's unfortunate that the seller is not responding to your messages and calls. This lack of communication is not acceptable, especially since you're trying to report a problem with a product they sold you.


Considering the seller is unreachable, one option is to send a notice to them, demanding a resolution to this issue. If they still don't respond, you might need to consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.


Would you like me to guide you through drafting a notice to the seller? This could be a starting point for resolving this issue.


Also, please note that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance in resolving this issue. They can provide you with more information and guidance on the next steps to take.


Human: yes


AI: I can help you draft a notice to the seller, detailing the issue with the fridge and demanding a resolution.


Here's a sample notice you can use as a starting point:


**Notice to [Seller's Name]**


**Subject: Defective Fridge - Demand for Replacement or Refund**


Dear [Seller's Name],


Re: Sale of Second-Hand Fridge (Order Number: [Order Number])


I am writing to inform you that the second-hand fridge I purchased from you on eBay (Order Number: [Order Number]) is defective and not functioning properly. Despite my attempts to set it up, the fridge did not switch on.


I had informed you about this issue through multiple texts and calls on [Date], but unfortunately, I have not received any response from you.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, I demand that you take immediate action to rectify this situation. I request you to replace the defective fridge with a new one or provide a full refund of the purchase price within 7 days from the date of this notice.


If I do not hear from you within this timeframe, I will be forced to take further action, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.


Please confirm in writing that you have received this notice and indicate your plan of action to resolve this issue.


Yours sincerely,


[Your Name]


Please note that this is a sample notice, and you should modify it to fit your specific situation. Also, make sure to keep a record of the notice, including the date and time it was sent, as well as any subsequent correspondence.


Before sending the notice, I would like to offer you some guidance on the next steps to take. Would you like me to walk you through that process?

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: hi\nChatbot: It seems like you've initiated a conversation, but you haven't shared a specific consumer grievance. Could you please tell me about the issue you're facing in a particular sector, such as Airlines, Automobile, Banking, or any other? This will help me assist you better.\nUser: i purchased a second hand fridge from a seller on ebay. it was delivered to me yesterday but its not working. the seller is unreachable\nChatbot: Thank you for sharing this concern with me. I'm here to help.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat sounds frustrating, especially when the seller is unreachable. Can you please tell me what led to the issue with the fridge not working? Was it immediately apparent when you unpacked it, or did it start malfunctioning after a short period of use?\nUser: it did not switch on\nChatbot: The fact that the fridge did not switch on immediately suggests that there might be a more serious issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou mentioned that the seller is unreachable. That's a problem. \r\n\r\n\r\nCan you please tell me when did you purchase this fridge and when did you notice this issue, specifically?\nUser: i purchased it 2 weeks ago and it was delivered to me yesterday. i tried to set it up but it did not switch on\nChatbot: It seems like you purchased the fridge 2 weeks ago, but the issue only became apparent when it was delivered to you yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the Consumer Protection Act in India, the time limit to file a complaint is generally 2 years from the date of purchase. Since you purchased the fridge 2 weeks ago, you're still within this time limit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you please tell me if you have any communication with the seller, such as an email or a message on eBay, that you can share with me? This might be helpful in drafting a complaint if needed.\nUser: i texted and called the seller multiple times informing them of the issue, but no response\nChatbot: It's unfortunate that the seller is not responding to your messages and calls. This lack of communication is not acceptable, especially since you're trying to report a problem with a product they sold you.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the seller is unreachable, one option is to send a notice to them, demanding a resolution to this issue. If they still don't respond, you might need to consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you like me to guide you through drafting a notice to the seller? This could be a starting point for resolving this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance in resolving this issue.
