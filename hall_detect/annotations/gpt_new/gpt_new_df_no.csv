"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I have a property dispute with my brother. Please help.


AI: I'm a consumer grievance assistance tool, and I'm here to help with consumer-related issues. I'm not trained to handle property disputes between family members. Property disputes often involve legal and family law aspects, which may require the assistance of a lawyer or a mediator.


However, if there's a consumer-related issue linked to your property dispute, I'd be happy to help. For example, if the dispute involves a real estate agent, a contractor, or any other service provider, I can assist you with filing a complaint or providing guidance on consumer laws related to real estate.


Could you please clarify if there's a consumer-related aspect to your property dispute with your brother?


Human: No there isn't. But can you help me with the next steps in this issue?


AI: Since this is a property dispute between family members, I would recommend seeking the help of a lawyer or a mediator who specializes in family law. They can provide you with guidance on the next steps to take and help you navigate the process.


However, I can suggest some general steps you may want to consider:


1.  Open communication: Try to have an open and honest conversation with your brother to understand each other's perspectives and try to find a mutually acceptable solution.
2.  Mediation: Consider seeking the help of a mediator who can facilitate a discussion between you and your brother to resolve the dispute.
3.  Consult a lawyer: If the issue is complex or you're unable to reach an agreement, consider consulting a lawyer who specializes in family law.
4.  Seek support: If the situation is causing emotional distress, consider seeking support from a therapist or a counselor.


If you have any consumer-related questions or concerns, I'm here to help.


Human: Can you recommend some good lawyers in Delhi?


AI: I'm a consumer grievance assistance tool, and I don't have the ability to recommend specific lawyers or provide personal recommendations. However, I can suggest some options to help you find a suitable lawyer in Delhi:

4.  **Word of Mouth**: Ask friends, family, or colleagues for recommendations. They may have had a positive experience with a lawyer in the past and can provide a personal reference.


When selecting a lawyer, consider factors such as:

Another remedy available to consumers is mediation. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells and resolving consumer complaints using mediation.

"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: Hi, I need help with an issue. I bought a car from Pacific Motors, traded in my old vehicle, and paid the remaining amount. I asked for the car to be registered in Agra, but the dealer charged me for registration in Nainital, where it couldn't be registered. They also overcharged me for insurance and the car itself. The car is still unused, and I'm paying interest on a loan. What should I do next?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to guide you through the process.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me more about what led to this issue? Was it a verbal or written agreement with the dealer regarding the registration and insurance?


Human: I had requested the dealer to register it in Agra but the dealer still went ahead to register it in Nainital


AI: It seems like there was a miscommunication or a breach of agreement between you and the dealer.


Considering this, you may want to consider taking legal action against the dealer. Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few more details. Can you please tell me if you have any documentation or evidence of your agreement with the dealer, such as a written confirmation or a receipt that mentions the registration in Agra?


Human: The request for registration in Agra was made by me in-person so I don't have any record


AI: Even without written documentation, you can still proceed with filing a complaint against the dealer.


Considering the overcharging for insurance and the car, as well as the incorrect registration, you may be entitled to a refund or compensation. You can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRC) or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), depending on the jurisdiction.


Before we proceed with drafting a complaint, can you please tell me what kind of relief you are seeking from the dealer? Are you looking for a refund of the excess amount paid, compensation for the interest on the loan, or something else?


Human: I want refund I'm seeking a refund of the excess amount I paid, including the overcharge for the car and insurance. Additionally, I would like compensation for the mental and financial stress caused by this situation.


AI: You are entitled to a refund of the excess amount paid, and compensation for the mental and financial stress caused by this situation.


Under the Consumer Protection Act, you can claim a refund of the excess amount paid, along with interest on that amount. You can also claim compensation for the mental and financial stress caused by the dealer's actions.


I can help you draft a complaint that you can file with the DCDRC or NCDRC. However, before we proceed, I would like to inform you that you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process and provide you with further assistance.


Additionally, if you'd like, I can provide you with a draft complaint that you can use as a template. Would you like me to do that?


Also, I would like to inform you that the Supreme Court has held in the case of Honda Cars India Ltd. vs Sudesh Berry that vehicle manufacturers cannot be held liable for deficiencies in service by dealers or authorized service agents. However, in your case, it seems like the dealer is the one who is at fault.


Lastly, to file a complaint, you can use the format provided by the DCDRC or NCDRC. You can find the formats on their websites or on the Consumer Helpline website. Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint?

Human: I had breathing issues in November last year. When i got check up done by a general physician she advised me some tests. Based on those tests she told me I have severe bronchitis and need complete rest. She gave me a lot of medications including 6 injections per day and nebulization 3 times per day. My situation got worse after a few days. She told me that I need to get admitted. But I went to another pulmonologist who told me that I don't have bronchitis and breathing issues are just due to anxiety. Now I want compensation from the general physician 


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you navigate the process.


Firstly, it's understandable that you're seeking compensation from the general physician for the misdiagnosis and treatment. To proceed, I have a few questions to clarify the situation:


1. Did you receive a bill or any medical records from the general physician that you can use as evidence?
2. Have you already tried to contact the general physician or her clinic to discuss your concerns and seek a refund or compensation?
3. What kind of compensation are you seeking from the general physician (e.g., refund of medical expenses, compensation for emotional distress, or something else)?


Human: I have bills and all medical records from the general physician. I don't want to contact her or the hospital she works in regarding the issue anymore. I need refund of medical expenses which was more than 10000 and compensation for emotional distress amounting to 50000 as I had to miss college for two weeks and had so many medicines my body did not need. 


AI: I understand your concerns and the compensation you're seeking. Given the misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, you have a strong case for medical negligence.


To proceed, I'd like to inform you about the possible legal remedies available to you. You can file a complaint against the general physician under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.


Since you have the bills and medical records, we can draft a complaint to be filed at the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRF) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC), depending on the jurisdiction.


Before we proceed, I'd like to inform you about the possible reliefs you can seek:


1. Refund of the medical expenses (over ₹10,000)
2. Compensation for emotional distress (₹50,000)
3. Other possible reliefs, such as compensation for the time lost due to unnecessary treatment and medication


Please note that you'll need to provide the medical records, bills, and any other relevant documents as evidence to support your claim.


Would you like me to help you draft a complaint or would you like to file a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the e-daakhil portal?


Human: Yes please draft a complaint


AI: Based on the information you provided, I'll draft a complaint for you. Please review it carefully and let me know if you'd like to make any changes.

**Name:** [Your Name]
**Address:** [Your Address]
**Phone Number:** [Your Phone Number]
**Email:** [Your Email]


**Against:** [General Physician's Name]

To, The State Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRF)/State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC)


Subject: Complaint against [General Physician's Name] for Medical Negligence and Unnecessary Treatment


I, [Your Name], a student, residing at [Your Address], file this complaint against [General Physician's Name], who practices at [Hospital Name], [Address].


**Background:**


I visited [General Physician's Name] on [Date] for a check-up and was advised to undergo certain tests. Based on the test results, she diagnosed me with severe bronchitis and prescribed 6 injections per day and nebulization 3 times a day. However, after a few days, my condition worsened, and I was advised to be admitted to the hospital. I was under the impression that I was suffering from a serious medical condition.


**Misdiagnosis and Unnecessary Treatment:**


Subsequently, I visited another pulmonologist, who diagnosed me with anxiety and not bronchitis. I was shocked to learn that the treatment I received from [General Physician's Name] was unnecessary and caused me significant emotional distress.


**Relief Sought:**


I seek the following reliefs:


1. Refund of the medical expenses incurred by me, which amount to ₹10,000 and above.
2. Compensation for emotional distress, which I suffered due to the misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, amounting to ₹50,000.


**Evidence:**


I attach herewith the following documents as evidence:


* Medical bills and records from [General Physician's Name]
* Test results and reports
* Prescription and medication details


**Prayer:**


I pray that this Hon'ble Forum/Commission may pass an order directing [General Physician's Name] to refund the medical expenses and compensate me for the emotional distress suffered.


**Signature:** [Your Signature]


Please review the complaint and let me know if you'd like to make any changes. Once you're satisfied, we can proceed with filing the complaint.


Would you like me to guide you on how to file the complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the e-daakhil portal?


Human: Can I file a complaint against the hospital as well


AI: As the hospital is also responsible for the actions of its staff, including the general physician, you can definitely file a complaint against the hospital as well.


However, you'll need to specify the role of the hospital in the complaint. Since the general physician works at the hospital, you can include the hospital as a respondent in the complaint.


Here's an updated draft:

Subject: Complaint against [General Physician's Name] and [Hospital Name] for Medical Negligence and Unnecessary Treatment


I, [Your Name], a student, residing at [Your Address], file this complaint against [General Physician's Name], who practices at [Hospital Name], [Address], and [Hospital Name].


**Background:**


I visited [General Physician's Name] on [Date] for a check-up and was advised to undergo certain tests. Based on the test results, she diagnosed me with severe bronchitis and prescribed 6 injections per day and nebulization 3 times a day. However, after a few days, my condition worsened, and I was advised to be admitted to the hospital. I was under the impression that I was suffering from a serious medical condition.


**Misdiagnosis and Unnecessary Treatment:**


Subsequently, I visited another pulmonologist, who diagnosed me with anxiety and not bronchitis. I was shocked to learn that the treatment I received from [General Physician's Name] was unnecessary and caused me significant emotional distress.


**Liability of the Hospital:**


As [Hospital Name] is responsible for the actions of its staff, including [General Physician's Name], I hold the hospital liable for the medical negligence and unnecessary treatment. The hospital failed to ensure that its staff provided proper medical care and attention to my condition.


**Relief Sought:**


I seek the following reliefs:


1. Refund of the medical expenses incurred by me, which amount to ₹10,000 and above.
2. Compensation for emotional distress, which I suffered due to the misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, amounting to ₹50,000.
3. Compensation for the time lost due to unnecessary treatment and medication.


**Evidence:**


I attach herewith the following documents as evidence:


* Medical bills and records from [General Physician's Name]
* Test results and reports
* Prescription and medication details
* Hospital admission and discharge documents


**Prayer:**


I pray that this Hon'ble Forum/Commission may pass an order directing [General Physician's Name] and [Hospital Name] to refund the medical expenses, compensate me for the emotional distress suffered, and compensate me for the time lost due to unnecessary treatment and medication.

"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: Hi, I subscribed to a gym membership with a promise of a refund if not satisfied within 30 days, I am unsatisfied but now they’re refusing to cancel. What should I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with this issue.


To better understand the situation, could you please tell me what led to your dissatisfaction with the gym membership? Was it related to the services provided, the facilities, or something else?


Human: The gym is almost always overcrowded, especially during peak hours, which limits my ability to use the facilities as promised. Even the hygiene and cleanliness standards are not up to the mark, and I've noticed that the locker rooms and showers are often dirty.


AI: It sounds like the gym has not met your expectations in terms of the quality of service and facilities.


As you mentioned, you had a refund clause in your subscription agreement, which states that you can get a refund if you're not satisfied within 30 days. However, the gym is now refusing to cancel your membership. 


Considering this, you may want to consider sending a legal notice to the gym, stating your grievances and requesting a refund or cancellation of your membership. I can help you draft a sample legal notice if you'd like.


Before we proceed, would you like me to provide you with a draft legal notice or would you like to explore any other options first?


Human: what are my other options?


AI: Before sending a legal notice, you can try to resolve the issue amicably by reaching out to the gym directly. Here are a few options you can consider:


1. **Contact the gym's customer care**: Reach out to the gym's customer care number or email and express your concerns. They might be willing to work with you to resolve the issue.
2. **Speak with the gym manager**: Schedule a meeting with the gym manager to discuss your concerns and see if they can provide a solution.
3. **Request a refund or cancellation in writing**: Write a formal letter to the gym, reiterating your concerns and requesting a refund or cancellation of your membership.


If these options don't work, sending a legal notice is a good next step.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide support in resolving your issue.


Would you like me to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to try to resolve the issue through the above-mentioned options first?


Human: I have already tried to reach out and they did not respond well to that. I would like to go ahead with the legal notice. Please draft a sample.


AI: Given the gym's unresponsive behavior, sending a legal notice is a good next step.


Here's a sample draft of a legal notice that you can use as a template:

If I do not receive a satisfactory response or refund within the stipulated time, I will be forced to take further action to protect my rights as a consumer.


Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and confirm the refund amount and processing details.


Yours sincerely,

Please note that this is a sample draft, and you should modify it to suit your specific situation. Also, make sure to keep a record of the notice, including the date and time of dispatch, and the method of dispatch (email, post, etc.).


Before sending the notice, would you like me to suggest any changes or additions?


Human: No, I will fill in the exact details. Thank you for the help.


AI: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. I hope the gym responds positively to your notice and provides a satisfactory resolution to your issue.

Subject: Complaint for Unauthorised Double Charging of Subscription Fee


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Complaint for Unauthorised Double Charging of Subscription Fee


I am writing to bring to your attention a grievance regarding the unauthorized double charging of my monthly subscription fee for the month of [current month]. On [date], I was charged an amount of Rs. 1400, which is double the usual monthly charge of Rs. 700.


I have been a subscriber to your streaming service since [start date] and have always paid my bills on time. However, this month, I noticed that the amount was debited twice from my account. I have tried contacting your customer service multiple times, but unfortunately, I have not received any response.


I request you to look into this matter urgently and refund the excess amount of Rs. 700 to my account at the earliest. If not, I will be forced to take further action to protect my consumer rights.


My subscription details are as follows:


- Subscription Plan: [Monthly Plan]
- Subscription ID: [Subscription ID, if available]

"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I sent my suit for dry cleaning, but it doesn’t feel or look like it was cleaned properly—there are still some creases and spots that I would expect to be removed. Is there any way to confirm if it was actually dry cleaned?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to the problem with your suit not feeling or looking clean after dry cleaning? Was it a specific incident or a general experience with the dry cleaner?


Human: Well, it's more of a general experience with this dry cleaner, but this time it was especially bad. I picked up the suit yesterday, and when I got home, I noticed there were still wrinkles on the sleeves and a few faint stains on the jacket that should have been removed. I’m sure I sent it in for dry cleaning and not just pressing, so I don’t understand why it still looks like this. It makes me wonder if they skipped the actual dry cleaning process altogether.


AI: It sounds like you're quite dissatisfied with the service you received from the dry cleaner. To proceed, can you please tell me when you sent the suit for dry cleaning? This will help me determine if the issue might be within the statute of limitations for filing a complaint. Today's date is 2024-09-09.


Human: I sent it 20 days ago.


AI: Since you sent the suit for dry cleaning 20 days ago, you still have sufficient time to file a complaint. However, it's essential to note that the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years from the date the cause of action arises. 


To move forward, could you please provide me with the name and contact details of the dry cleaner you used? This information will help me guide you on the next steps to take.


Human: The name of the dry cleaner is ""Fresh Press Dry Cleaners,"" and they're located on main street in malleshwaram. Their contact number is (123) 456-7890. 


AI: I've noted the details of the dry cleaner. Now, let's discuss the relief you're seeking. What kind of action would you like to take regarding this issue? Do you want to ask for a refund, a re-cleaning of the suit, or something else?


Human: I want compensation, and re-cleaning. 


AI: You'd like to seek compensation and a re-cleaning of the suit. Considering this, I would recommend sending a formal notice to the dry cleaner, ""Fresh Press Dry Cleaners,"" to give them an opportunity to rectify the issue. A notice should include the defects in the service (in this case, the poor cleaning of the suit) and your intention to pursue further action if they fail to provide compensation and re-clean the suit.


Would you like me to help you draft a sample notice? 


Also, I'd like to inform you that you can reach out to the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance. If you need a location-based helpline number, I can provide that as well.


Human: I have reached out to them, they did not respond positively.


AI: Since the dry cleaner hasn't responded positively to your initial communication, the next step would be to file a formal complaint. You can do this by visiting the nearest Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRF) or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, as the case may be. 


You can also register your complaint on the e-daakhil portal or the National Consumer Helpline's online platform. Additionally, you can submit a complaint to the District Collector of the respective district for investigation and subsequent proceedings by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA).

"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: i purchased a vape and it burned me. what remedy do i have?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the vape? Was it a manufacturing defect, a faulty product, or something else?


Human: im not sure. i inhaled from it and it became burning hot and burnt my mouth


AI: It sounds like you experienced a severe reaction to the vape. 


To initiate a product liability action under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you'll need to demonstrate that the harm resulted from a ""defective product."" In this case, it seems that the vape might have been defective or malfunctioned.


Can you please tell me when this incident occurred? Please provide me with the date or an approximate date when you inhaled from the vape and experienced the burning sensation.


Human: it occurred yesterday


AI: So, the incident occurred on 2024-09-29, which is within the two-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India.


Since the incident is relatively recent, you can consider taking legal action to seek compensation for the harm you suffered.


Before proceeding, can you please tell me about the vape you purchased? Do you have the product details, such as the brand name, model number, or any other relevant information?


Human: it was a Raya vape


AI: So, the vape that caused the harm was a Raya vape.


Since you're looking to take legal action, I can guide you on the next steps. However, before that, I'd like to know more about the desired relief. What are you seeking from the Raya vape manufacturer or the dealer from whom you purchased the product?


Are you looking for compensation for medical expenses, damage to property (if any), or something else?


Human: im looking for a replacement with a functional vape


AI: You're looking for a replacement for the defective Raya vape with a functional one.


Before moving forward, I would like to inform you that you have the option to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance. You can also check the location-based helpline number for your state.


However, if you wish to pursue a complaint through the consumer courts, I can help you draft a notice to the Raya vape manufacturer or the dealer. This notice will outline the incident, the harm caused, and the desired relief.


Would you like me to assist you in drafting a notice for the Raya vape manufacturer or the dealer?
