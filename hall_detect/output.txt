Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.

2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?
3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?


Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
User: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell
Chatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.

User: I need gas
Chatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.


Can you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?
User: i need gas only once
Chatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.


If you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.

Chatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.

The user is located in Bidar and finds the KSDRC location in Bangalore too far, suggesting they may need assistance with filing a complaint remotely or finding a local alternative. |<|reserved_special_token_147|>I'll provide the reformulated statement for each example:

Example 1:
Chat History:
Human: What is Task Decomposition?
AI: Task Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex task into smaller and simpler steps. This is achieved through a technique called Chain of Thought (CoT), which instructs the model to "think step by step" and utilize more test-time computation to transform big tasks into multiple manageable tasks.
Human: Can you provide an example of Chain of Thought reasoning?
AI: Sure! Let’s say the task is to determine how many apples are left in a basket after some have been eaten. The Chain of Thought reasoning would involve steps like calculating the original number of apples, subtracting the number eaten, and arriving at the final count.
Statement: What are the advantages of using this approach?
Reformulated Statement: The user is asking about the benefits of using Task Decomposition.

Example 2:
Chat History:
Human: What is the principle of stare decisis in law?
AI: The principle of stare decisis refers to the legal doctrine of adhering to precedent, where courts are bound to follow the decisions of higher courts in similar cases to ensure consistency and predictability in the legal system.
Human: Can you explain why it is important in the judicial process?
AI: Stare decisis is important because it promotes legal stability, predictability, and fairness. It ensures that similar cases are treated alike, reduces judicial arbitrariness, and helps individuals and businesses understand their legal obligations.
Statement: What are some exceptions to this principle?
Reformulated Statement: The user is inquiring about the exceptions to the principle of stare decisis.

Example 3:
Chat History:
Human: What is a contract?
AI: A contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties that creates mutual obligations. It requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and the intention to create legal relations to be valid.
Human: What happens if one party breaches a contract?
AI: If one party breaches a contract, the other party may seek remedies such as damages, specific performance, or rescission, depending on the terms of the contract and the severity of the breach.
Statement: Can you explain the difference between damages and specific performance?
Reformulated Statement: The user is asking for clarification

You can contact the DCDRF in Bidar at:

Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User: I need gas
Chatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.


Can you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?
User: i need gas only once
Chatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.


If you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?
User: the gas cylinder is faulty
Chatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.


If the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.


Additionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.


To facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:

Chatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.

Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.

Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User: I need gas
Chatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.


Can you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?
User: i need gas only once
Chatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.


If you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?
User: the gas cylinder is faulty
Chatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.


If the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.


Additionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.


To facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:


1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?
2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?
3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?


Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
User: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell
Chatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?
User: yes. no response on the helpline
Chatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.


Do you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.


If the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.


Additionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.


To facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:


1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?
2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?
3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?


Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.

3. The response incorrectly states that the customer should contact their LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement, when in fact the context explicitly states that the customer has already contacted the distributor.
4. The response suggests that the customer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance, but does not provide any additional information or guidance on how to do so.
5. The response incorrectly states that the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is available 24*7 for assistance, when in fact the context explicitly states that the helpline is available 24*7 with 2 shifts of 12 hours each.

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

Degree of Inconsistency: 3

Explanation: The chatbot introduces a sample complaint form that is not supported by the context, which is a minor inconsistency. However, it does not significantly impact the overall accuracy of the response. The chatbot should have stuck to providing general guidance on how to file a complaint rather than providing a sample form.

DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.
