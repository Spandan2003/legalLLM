It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.


If you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

relevant service records, conducting interviews, or even arranging for on-site inspections if necessary . The goal is to identify the root cause and determine an appropriate resolution.● Resolution Communication - Once the investigation is complete, the service provider communicates the resolution to the customer . This communication includes details about the actions taken to address the complaint and any compensation or corrective measures implemented. ● Feedback and Follow-Up - Service providers often seek feedback from customers regarding the resolution process to assess customer satisfaction. Follow-up communications ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and that the customer is content with the outcome. ● Escalation Mechanism - In cases where the customer is dissatisfied with the resolution or believes that the complaint has not been adequately addressed, there may be an escalation mechanism. This could involve contacting a higher -level customer service representative ○ Solely   act   in   a   financial   capacity   regarding   the   product   sale, ○ Are   not   manufacturers,   wholesalers,   distributors,   retailers,   direct   sellers,   or   electronic   service   providers, ○ Lease   a   product   without   having   a   reasonable   opportunity   to   inspect   for   defects,   under   a   lease   arrangement   where   selection,   possession,   maintenance,   and   operation   are   controlled   by   someone   other   than   the   lessor .”   — Question:   “What   are   the   Consumer   Dispute   Redressal   Agencies?” Answer:   “   Consumer   Disputes   Redressal   Agencies,   established   under   the   Consumer   Protection   Act,   are   quasi-judicial   bodies   offering   prompt   and   affordable   resolution   to   consumer   grievances.

Mediation: Another remedy available to consumers is mediation. Mediation involves a neutral third party facilitating discussions between the consumer and the technology service provider to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. This approach often provides a quicker and less adversarial way to settle disputes, promoting a win-win situation. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells and resolving consumer complaints using mediation. 4. Central Consumer Protection Authority: If the commission finds violations of rights of consumers or in notice of trade practices which is unfair it can inquire or cause an inquiry, either on receipt of complaint or suo moto or as directed by Central Government.

DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?
