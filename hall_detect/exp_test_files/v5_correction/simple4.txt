Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.


Do you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?

DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Being far from the airport can indeed cause delays in baggage handling. However, the airline should still ensure that your baggage is handled efficiently and reaches you in a timely manner.


Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from Air India regarding this incident? Are you looking for a refund, compensation, or something else?

response    abcdefghijk
I understand that not only was your baggage delayed, but you also missed a conference due to the airline's inefficiency. As per the Air India's policy, if a flight is delayed by more than six hours, the airline should offer meals and refreshments to passengers. Since your flight was delayed, you should have been provided with refreshments.


Regarding the compensation, you are eligible for it since you missed a conference due to the airline's delay. The compensation amount can range between â‚¹5,000 to â‚¹10,000, depending on the block time (the time between the departure of a flight from the gate and arrival at the destination gate).


I can help you draft a letter to Air India for compensation. Would you like me to provide you with a draft letter? 


Also, I would like to inform you that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation. Would you like me to provide you with the contact number of the local consumer helpline as well?

Subject: Compensation Claim for Delayed Baggage and Missed Conference


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Flight [Flight Number] from [Departure City] to [Destination City] on [Date]


I am writing to bring to your notice a disturbing incident that occurred during my travel with Air India on [Date]. My baggage was stuck at the airport for over an hour due to the flight being parked far from the airport. Although I understand that this might have been a technical issue, I was not provided with any refreshments or alternate methods of getting my bags.


As a result, I missed a conference that I had scheduled for [Time] on [Date]. This has caused me significant inconvenience and financial loss.


As per the Air India's policy, I am entitled to compensation for the delay and inconvenience caused. I request you to provide me with compensation of â‚¹ [amount] for the trouble caused.


I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently and take necessary steps to resolve it. I would also appreciate a response regarding the steps you will take to prevent such incidents in the future.


My PNR number is [PNR Number] and my booking reference number is [Booking Reference Number]. I have attached a copy of my ticket and a receipt for the conference I missed.


Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Yours sincerely,


[Your Name]


Please note that you should fill in the brackets with your actual details and attach the required documents. Also, you can modify the letter as per your specific situation.


Also, don't forget to contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Since your flight was delayed in Bombay, you can submit your complaint to Air India's Mumbai office. However, I would recommend filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal at [cpGRAMS.gov.in](http://cpGRAMS.gov.in). This portal is managed by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.


If you prefer to submit a physical complaint, you can visit the Air India office in Mumbai. Here is the address:


Air India Limited
Mumbai Office
A Wing, 12th Floor, 16/18, J.N. Heredia Marg, Ballard Estate,
Mumbai - 400 001.


Please note that you may need to make an appointment or contact them in advance to file a complaint.


Also, you can download the RailMadad App or visit the RailMadad portal at [railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in](http://railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in) to file a complaint.

You can indeed file a complaint with the Air India office in Bangalore. It would be more convenient for you to visit their office in person and file a complaint.


Here is the address of the Air India office in Bangalore:


Air India Limited
Bangalore Office
No. 32, 4th Floor, Brigade Gateway, 26/27, Opp. Metro Station, Off. MG Road,
Bangalore - 560 025.


You can visit this office and file a complaint with their customer service team. They will guide you through the process and help you with your issue.


Before you visit, it's a good idea to call them and make an appointment or confirm their office hours to avoid any inconvenience.


Additionally, don't forget to keep a copy of your complaint and any supporting documents, such as your ticket and receipt for the conference you missed.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

In that case, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The DCDRF is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district.


You can contact the DCDRF in Bidar at:


District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum,
Bidar,
Bidar District Court Complex,
Bidar - 585401.


Phone: 08482-252522


You can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance and guidance on the process of filing a complaint.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

response    abcdefghijk
DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

When would complaints not be accepted?There are various situations which might cause the complaint to be rejected. These include situations where the consumer is unable to file an appeal against an order within a period of three months, where the complaint is based on a frivolous cause of action, where the complaint falls outside the jurisdiction of the authority approached, and when the complaint has been filed under wrong sections of the act, and other such situations. This requires careful reading of all acts of the chosen commission (e.g., District Commission for complaints under ₹1 crore), it will be rejected. Careful consideration of the complaint value and commission jurisdiction is crucial. ● Procedural Errors: Filing complaints under incorrect sections of the CPA or relevant sports/recreation regulations can lead to rejection. ● Lack of Consumer Status: To be eligible for consumer protection under the CPA, the complainant must fall under the definition of a "consumer" as defined in the Act. For instance, complaints from professional athletes who participate in sporting activities as part of their professional obligations may not be considered. ● Evidence and Proof: Insuf ficient evidence or lack of proof to substantiate the allegations in the complaint can result in its dismissal. ● Concurrent Litigation: Filing the same complaint in another judicial forum (e.g., civil court) before approaching the consumer commission can lead to its rejection due to "lis pendens" (already pending

Being far from the airport can indeed cause delays in baggage handling. However, the airline should still ensure that your baggage is handled efficiently and reaches you in a timely manner.


Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from Air India regarding this incident? Are you looking for a refund, compensation, or something else?

response    abcdefghijk
I understand that not only was your baggage delayed, but you also missed a conference due to the airline's inefficiency. As per the Air India's policy, if a flight is delayed by more than six hours, the airline should offer meals and refreshments to passengers. Since your flight was delayed, you should have been provided with refreshments.


Regarding the compensation, you are eligible for it since you missed a conference due to the airline's delay. The compensation amount can range between â‚¹5,000 to â‚¹10,000, depending on the block time (the time between the departure of a flight from the gate and arrival at the destination gate).


I can help you draft a letter to Air India for compensation. Would you like me to provide you with a draft letter? 


Also, I would like to inform you that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation. Would you like me to provide you with the contact number of the local consumer helpline as well?

Subject: Compensation Claim for Delayed Baggage and Missed Conference


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Flight [Flight Number] from [Departure City] to [Destination City] on [Date]


I am writing to bring to your notice a disturbing incident that occurred during my travel with Air India on [Date]. My baggage was stuck at the airport for over an hour due to the flight being parked far from the airport. Although I understand that this might have been a technical issue, I was not provided with any refreshments or alternate methods of getting my bags.


As a result, I missed a conference that I had scheduled for [Time] on [Date]. This has caused me significant inconvenience and financial loss.


As per the Air India's policy, I am entitled to compensation for the delay and inconvenience caused. I request you to provide me with compensation of â‚¹ [amount] for the trouble caused.


I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently and take necessary steps to resolve it. I would also appreciate a response regarding the steps you will take to prevent such incidents in the future.


My PNR number is [PNR Number] and my booking reference number is [Booking Reference Number]. I have attached a copy of my ticket and a receipt for the conference I missed.


Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Yours sincerely,


[Your Name]


Please note that you should fill in the brackets with your actual details and attach the required documents. Also, you can modify the letter as per your specific situation.


Also, don't forget to contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

```

This code defines a function `evaluate_inconsistencies` that takes two inputs: `inconsistency_present` and `inconsistencies`. It checks if inconsistencies are present, removes invalid inconsistencies, assigns a degree of inconsistency, and appends the corrected inconsistencies to a list. Finally, it outputs the result in the specified format.

You can test the function with the provided input data by calling the function with the input data as arguments. The output will be printed to the console.

Since your flight was delayed in Bombay, you can submit your complaint to Air India's Mumbai office. However, I would recommend filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance.

This portal is managed by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.

Air India Limited
Mumbai Office
A Wing, 12th Floor, 16/18, J.N. Heredia Marg, Ballard Estate,
Mumbai - 400 001.


Please note that you may need to make an appointment or contact them in advance to file a complaint.

The Drug Controller was ordered by the Commission to constitute an expert committee to review the provisions of the existing legislation regulating quality control and make recommendations. The Committee madecertain recommendations for protecting the public against the possibility of contamination of I. V. fluids. This case reiterates the fact that the rational drug policy must be accompanied by sustained campaign to enhance awareness of consumers. The literate and enlightened consumers have a greater role and responsibility for materialising the above exceeds 10 crores.

response    abcdefghijk
It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

approaching District, State, or National Consumer Commissions, depending on the jurisdiction and the value of the technology services in question. Typically, courts only interfere if the decision is illogical, suffers from procedural impropriety or shocks the conscience of the court. The complainant is free to take the service provider to a court or any other suitable venue (judicial or quasi-judicial). The proceedings in consumer commissions are not mired by the niceties of procedure, allowing the complainant to file a complaint for himself. As a consumer, the aggrieved party can take the service provider to the appropriate consumer commission, based on the pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction. The jurisdictions of the various consumer commissions are as follows a) District Commission: The aggrieved consumer can reach out to the District Commission under section 34 of the CPA, 2019, which provides that the district commission shall entertain matters where the value of the goods or

can entertain matters where the value of goods or services paid as consideration exceeds 10 crores. Section 58 also provides that complaints against unfair contracts can be entertained by NCDRC when the amount of value paid exceeds 10 crores. The NCDRC also has appellate jurisdiction against the orders of any State Commission and Central Authority. Moreover, it must also be kept in mind that section 100 of the CPA, 2019 provides that the remedy under CPA is in addition and not in derogation of other available remedies. 3. Mediation: Another remedy available to consumers is mediation. Mediation involves a neutral third party facilitating discussions between the consumer and the technology service provider to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. This approach often provides a quicker and less adversarial way to settle disputes, promoting a win-win situation. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells and resolving consumer complaints using

conducting interviews, or even arranging for on-site inspections if necessary . The goal is to identify the root cause and determine an appropriate resolution.● Resolution Communication - Once the investigation is complete, the service provider communicates the resolution to the customer . This communication includes details about the actions taken to address the complaint and any compensation or corrective measures implemented. ● Feedback and Follow-Up - Service providers often seek feedback from customers regarding the resolution process to assess customer satisfaction. Follow-up communications ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and that the customer is content with the outcome. ● Escalation Mechanism - In cases where the customer is dissatisfied with the resolution or believes that the complaint has not been adequately addressed, there may be an escalation mechanism. This could involve contacting a higher -level customer service representative or a dedicated complaints

It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.


If you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

If the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.


Additionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.


To facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:


1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?
2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?
3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?


Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

The KSDRC office in Bangalore might be a bit far from Bidar.


In that case, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The DCDRF is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district.


You can contact the DCDRF in Bidar at:


District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum,
Bidar,
Bidar District Court Complex,
Bidar - 585401.


Phone: 08482-252522


You can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance and guidance on the process of filing a complaint.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Inconsistencies:
1. The chatbot provides a sample complaint form that is not an official form and should be used as a reference only. However, it does not provide the actual official complaint form that can be downloaded from the DCDRF website or obtained in person from their office. This is an inconsistency as the chatbot is supposed to guide the user through the process of filling out a complaint form, but it does not provide the correct and official form. 
2. The chatbot mentions that the e-daakhil portal is only available for filing complaints against entities that are registered on the portal, but it does not clarify that the entity must be registered with the e-daakhil portal specifically, not just any registration. This is an inconsistency as the chatbot is supposed to provide accurate information about the e-daakhil portal. 

Note: The inconsistencies listed above are based on the given context and history. The chatbot's response may be incomplete or inaccurate, but it does not necessarily mean that the chatbot is incorrect in its entirety.

response    abcdefghijk
DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

response    abcdefghijk
Being far from the airport can indeed cause delays in baggage handling. However, the airline should still ensure that your baggage is handled efficiently and reaches you in a timely manner.


Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from Air India regarding this incident? Are you looking for a refund, compensation, or something else?

response    abcdefghijk
I understand that not only was your baggage delayed, but you also missed a conference due to the airline's inefficiency. As per the Air India's policy, if a flight is delayed by more than six hours, the airline should offer meals and refreshments to passengers. Since your flight was delayed, you should have been provided with refreshments.


Regarding the compensation, you are eligible for it since you missed a conference due to the airline's delay. The compensation amount can range between â‚¹5,000 to â‚¹10,000, depending on the block time (the time between the departure of a flight from the gate and arrival at the destination gate).


I can help you draft a letter to Air India for compensation. Would you like me to provide you with a draft letter? 


Also, I would like to inform you that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation. Would you like me to provide you with the contact number of the local consumer helpline as well?

Although I understand that this might have been a technical issue, I was not provided with any refreshments or alternate methods of getting my bags.


As a result, I missed a conference that I had scheduled for [Time] on [Date]. This has caused me significant inconvenience and financial loss.


As per the Air India's policy, I am entitled to compensation for the delay and inconvenience caused. I request you to provide me with compensation of â‚¹ [amount] for the trouble caused.


I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently and take necessary steps to resolve it. I would also appreciate a response regarding the steps you will take to prevent such incidents in the future.


My PNR number is [PNR Number] and my booking reference number is [Booking Reference Number]. I have attached a copy of my ticket and a receipt for the conference I missed.


Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Yours sincerely,


[Your Name]

response    abcdefghijk
Since your flight was delayed in Bombay, you can submit your complaint to Air India's Mumbai office. However, I would recommend filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal at [cpGRAMS.gov.in](http://cpGRAMS.gov.in). This portal is managed by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.


If you prefer to submit a physical complaint, you can visit the Air India office in Mumbai. Here is the address:


Air India Limited
Mumbai Office
A Wing, 12th Floor, 16/18, J.N. Heredia Marg, Ballard Estate,
Mumbai - 400 001.


Please note that you may need to make an appointment or contact them in advance to file a complaint.


Also, you can download the RailMadad App or visit the RailMadad portal at [railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in](http://railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in) to file a complaint.

You can indeed file a complaint with the Air India office in Bangalore. It would be more convenient for you to visit their office in person and file a complaint.


Here is the address of the Air India office in Bangalore:


Air India Limited
Bangalore Office
No. 32, 4th Floor, Brigade Gateway, 26/27, Opp. Metro Station, Off. MG Road,
Bangalore - 560 025.


You can visit this office and file a complaint with their customer service team. They will guide you through the process and help you with your issue.


Before you visit, it's a good idea to call them and make an appointment or confirm their office hours to avoid any inconvenience.


Additionally, don't forget to keep a copy of your complaint and any supporting documents, such as your ticket and receipt for the conference you missed.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

When a manufacturer claims that the refrigerator marketed by him is the best or that it keeps the food inside germ-free, that claim should be backed by adequate data to substantiate the claim. Or else, it becomes a false statement.

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?
