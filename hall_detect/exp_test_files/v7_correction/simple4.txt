The user reports experiencing food poisoning and the chatbot expresses sympathy and asks for more details about the incident. The user reveals that the food poisoning was caused by a sandwich from Concu. The chatbot asks the user to provide more information about the sandwich, specifically the shop or restaurant where it was purchased. The chatbot offers general advice on how to proceed, suggesting that the user contact Concu's customer service team to report the incident and seek a resolution. The user states that Concu apologized but failed to compensate them.

response    abcdefghijk
It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

Careful consideration of the complaint value and commission jurisdiction is crucial. ● Procedural Errors: Filing complaints under incorrect sections of the CPA or relevant sports/recreation regulations can lead to rejection. ● Evidence and Proof: Insufficient evidence or lack of proof to substantiate the allegations in the complaint can result in its dismissal. ● Concurrent Litigation: Filing the same complaint in another judicial forum (e.g., civil court) before approaching the consumer commission can lead to its rejection due to "lis pendens"

response    abcdefghijk
It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

The user reports that they experienced food poisoning, likely due to a sandwich they purchased from a shop called Concu. The chatbot expresses sympathy and asks the user to provide more details about the incident, including the shop or restaurant where the sandwich was bought. The chatbot also asks if the user has already contacted Concu's customer service team about the incident. The user reveals that Concu apologized but failed to compensate them. The chatbot suggests that the user should contact Concu's customer service team again to seek a resolution and also recommends filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum if necessary.

response    abcdefghijk
It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

Or else, it is an incorrect statement or a false advertisement. When an advertisement promises to give you a ?free gift? every time you buy the advertised product, the free gift should really be so. If the manufacturer is recovering either fully or even partly, the cost of the so-called free gift, then the advertisement becomes false and misleading.

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

history    abcdefghijk
The user reports experiencing food poisoning and shares that it was caused by a sandwich from Concu. The chatbot asks for more information about the incident and the shop or restaurant where the user bought the sandwich. When the user reveals that Concu apologized but failed to compensate them, the chatbot suggests contacting Concu's customer service team directly to report the incident and seek a resolution. If the customer service team is unresponsive or unhelpful, the chatbot recommends filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum. The chatbot also offers to help the user draft a sample legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident and seeking compensation. The user requests both options, asking the chatbot to guide them on how to draft a sample legal notice and to file a complaint with the consumer forum.
