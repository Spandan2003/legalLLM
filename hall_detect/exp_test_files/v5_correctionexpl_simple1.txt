What is FSSA, 2006 & why this Act is needed? Food Safety and Standards Authority , 2006 is so. If the manufacturer is recovering either fully or even partly, the cost of the so-called free gift, then the advertisement becomes false and misleading. If a retailer claims that he is offering a special discount on his goods as part of a festival celebration, while he is actually using the festival as an excuse to get rid of old and outdated goods, then he is deceiving consumers. When a toothpaste advertisement says that it prevents cavities, one expects the manufacturer to have the data to prove this. If he fails to do that, then he is making an unsubstantiated claim or a false statement. If an advertisement for a face cream claims that it removes dark spots on the face and even prevents them from coming back, the manufacturer should be able to prove this. Or else, it is a deceptive advertisement. Even reducing crucial information about the product to minute letters at the bottom of the advertisement could be termed as an unfair trade practice, particularly if such information items insured. Consumers should also check authencity of Insurance companies especially if it is third party insurance. 8. Are any guidelines or regulator available for Packers and Movers companies?

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is in charge of regulating and monitoring food safety to safeguard and advance public health, which is correct. However, the response then asks for the name of the shop or restaurant where the sandwich was purchased, which is not relevant to the FSSAI's role in food safety regulation. This introduces a new topic that is not supported by the context.

Lack   of   Harm:   Even   if   the   product   was   defective,   it   did   not   cause   any   harm   to   the   consumer   who   used   it.” Question:   “   Under   what   conditions mechanism, and any other similar information which may be required by consumers to make informed decisions; (d) information on available payment methods, the security of those payment methods, any fees or charges payable by users, the procedure to cancel regular payments under those methods, charge-back options, (e) all information provided to it by sellers under sub-rule (5) of rule 6; and (f) an explanation of the main parameters which, individually or collectively , are most significant in determining the ranking of goods or sellers on its platform and the relative importance of those main parameters through an easily and publicly available description drafted in plain and intelligible language. (g) Every marketplace e-commerce entity shall include in its terms and conditions generally governing its relationship with sellers on its platform, a description of any differentiated treatment which it gives or might give between goods or services or sellers of the same category. (h) for   a   product, b)   Provides   additional   services,   such   as   installation,   for   a   product.” — Question:   “Who   is   responsible   if   several   parties   are   involved   in   the   manufacturing   of   a   product?” Answer:   “   In   cases   involving   multiple   manufacturers,   liability   is   determined   by   the   commission   on   a   case-by-case   basis.   Factors   considered   include   which   component   caused   the   defect   and   whether   proper   instructions   or   warnings   were   provided.   This   is   especially   relevant   for   products   like   home   appliances   and   automobiles   with   parts   from   different   manufacturers.   Courts   have   attempted   to   identify   the   responsible   party   in   past   cases   with   multiple   parties   involved.   If   assigning   liability   to   a   single   party   is   not   possible,   all   involved   parties   may   be   held   jointly   and   severally   liable.” — Question: contracts or within governing body rules applicable to athletes upon membership. The Arbitration Act grants courts broad powers to provide interim relief during arbitral proceedings. This includes measures like securing the disputed amount or appointing a receiver . General principles for granting interim reliefs in India involve demonstrating a prima facie case, a balance of convenience, and the likelihood of irreparable injury if the relief is not granted. 4. Approaching any other appropriate judicial or quasi-judicial body: The complainant is free to take the service provider to a court or any other suitable venue (judicial or quasi-judicial). The proceedings in consumer commissions are not mired by the niceties of procedure, allowing the complainant to file a complaint for himself. As a consumer , the aggrieved party can take the service provider to the appropriate consumer commission, based on the pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction. The jurisdictions of the various consumer decisions at the pre-purchase stage: Provided that a marketplace e-commerce entity shall, on a request in writing made by a consumer after the purchase of any goods or services on its platform by such consumer, provide him with information regarding the seller from which such consumer has made such purchase, including the principal geographic address of its headquarters and all branches, name and details of its website, its email address and any other information necessary for communication with the seller for effective dispute resolution; (b) a ticket number for each complaint lodged through which the consumer can track the status of the complaint;(c) information relating to return, refund, exchange, warranty and guarantee, delivery and shipment, modes of payment, and grievance redressal mechanism, and any other similar information which may be required by consumers to make informed decisions; (d) information on available payment methods, the security of those payment methods, any relevant service records, conducting interviews, or even arranging for on-site inspections if necessary . The goal is to identify the root cause and determine an appropriate resolution.● Resolution Communication - Once the investigation is complete, the service provider communicates the resolution to the customer . This communication includes details about the actions taken to address the complaint and any compensation or corrective measures implemented. ● Feedback and Follow-Up - Service providers often seek feedback from customers regarding the resolution process to assess customer satisfaction. Follow-up communications ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and that the customer is content with the outcome. ● Escalation Mechanism - In cases where the customer is dissatisfied with the resolution or believes that the complaint has not been adequately addressed, there may be an escalation mechanism. This could involve contacting a higher -level customer service representative in derogation of other available remedies. 3. Mediation: Another remedy available to consumers is mediation. Mediation involves a neutral third party facilitating discussions between the consumer and the technology service provider to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. This approach often provides a quicker and less adversarial way to settle disputes, promoting a win-win situation. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells and resolving consumer complaints using mediation. 4. Central Consumer Protection Authority: If the commission finds violations of rights of consumers or in notice of trade practices which is unfair it can inquire or cause an inquiry, either on receipt of complaint or suo moto or as directed by Central Government. If the commission finds, after preliminary inquiry, of an existence of a prima facie case of consumer rights violation or it is in notice of any unfair trade practice or any wrong or inaccurate advertisement in a specific period.

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

The following information is inconsistent:
1. The chatbot incorrectly states that the Consumer Protection Act 2019 came into effect on August 9, 2019, when it was only notified on that date and came into effect on July 20, 2020.
2. The chatbot claims the Consumer Protection Act 1986 is still valid, contradicting the fact that it was repealed by the 2019 Act.
3. The chatbot states that the Consumer Protection Act 2019 does not apply to e-commerce platforms, which is incorrect as the Act includes e-commerce and direct selling transactions.
4. The chatbot provides outdated pecuniary jurisdiction limits for district consumer courts, which were revised under the Consumer Protection Act 2019.
5. The chatbot states that only manufacturers are liable under product liability provisions, omitting the inclusion of sellers and service providers under the Act.
6. The chatbot states that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) can only handle individual complaints, which is incorrect since the CCPA can take suo-moto actions and initiate class actions.
7. The chatbot claims that the Consumer Protection Act 2019 introduced a new right to seek redressal, but this right was also present in the earlier Act of 1986.
8. The chatbot incorrectly states that mediation is mandatory for all consumer disputes under the 2019 Act, while it is an alternative, voluntary dispute resolution mechanism.
9. The chatbot mentions the applicability of the Consumer Protection Act 2019 to the entire country, but it fails to acknowledge the special provisions for Jammu & Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370.
10. The chatbot claims that an online complaint can only be filed through the National Consumer Helpline, but the Act allows for e-filing through all District, State, and National Commissions directly.
11. The chatbot states that only consumer protection councils are responsible for handling complaints, ignoring the role of District, State, and National Commissions under the 2019 Act.
