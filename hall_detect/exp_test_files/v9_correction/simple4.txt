The user initially contacts the chatbot for assistance with a gas-related issue, specifically looking for a one-time gas supply. The chatbot provides guidance on how to obtain a one-time gas supply and also offers contact information for the Customer Service Cell and the National Consumer Helpline. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty and requests assistance. The chatbot advises the user to contact the LPG distributor or the Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement, and also provides the LPG Emergency Helpline number for immediate assistance. The chatbot asks for additional information to facilitate the replacement process, including the cause of the issue, the receipt or serial number of the gas cylinder, and whether the user has already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell. The user decides to call the LPG Emergency Helpline (1906) and shares that they do not know what led to the problem, have the serial number, and have not yet contacted the service cell.

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.


Do you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?

Inconsistency Present: Yes
Explanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. These have been removed.
Inconsistencies:
Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.
Degree of Inconsistency: 4
Explanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.
Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.
Degree of Inconsistency: 3
Explanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.
Inconsistency: The response suggests contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.
Degree of Inconsistency: 5
Explanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.
Inconsistency: The response claims that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.

The user shares that they need gas only once, and the chatbot suggests registering for a one-time gas supply with the LPG distributor.

The chatbot advises the user to contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 and report the issue, providing the serial number of the gas cylinder. The user calls the helpline but receives no response, prompting the chatbot to suggest alternative options, including contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor, filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal, or contacting the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC).

The user starts the conversation by saying they need help with a faulty product purchased online, but later clarifies they need gas. The user expresses their need for a one-time gas supply, which the chatbot advises can be arranged through the LPG distributor in their area. However, the user later reveals that the gas cylinder is faulty and has not received a response from the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906. The chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Service Cell or filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000. The user decides to call the LPG Emergency Helpline, but when they don't receive a response, they ask for the toll-free number for Karnataka. The chatbot provides the numbers for the LPG distributors in Karnataka, including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum. When the user asks for the location of the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC), the chatbot provides the address in Bangalore and suggests visiting their website or contacting them by phone or email. However, the user expresses difficulty in traveling to Bangalore and lives in Bidar, so the chatbot does not provide any further assistance.

The KSDRC office in Bangalore might be a bit far from Bidar.


In that case, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The DCDRF is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district.


You can contact the DCDRF in Bidar at:


District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum,
Bidar,
Bidar District Court Complex,
Bidar - 585401.


Phone: 08482-252522


You can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance and guidance on the process of filing a complaint.

The user replies that they need gas only once, and the chatbot advises them to approach the LPG distributor in their area for a one-time supply. However, the chatbot also warns that the user may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill. The chatbot then offers additional options for assistance, including contacting the Customer Service Cell of the company or the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty and contacts the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906. After speaking with the helpline, the user reports that they did not receive a response. The chatbot then suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in the user's area or filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles. The user then asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, and the chatbot provides the numbers for the LPG distributors. The user then asks for the location of the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC), and the chatbot provides the address and contact details.

The chatbot asks the user to share the issue they are facing with the LPG supplier and whether it is related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else. The user reveals that they need gas only once and the chatbot suggests that they can approach the LPG distributor in their area to register for a one-time gas supply. However, the chatbot also warns that they may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill. The user then mentions that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises them to contact their LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also provides the user with various contact numbers for the LPG distributors, the National Consumer Helpline, and the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC). The user expresses difficulty in visiting the KSDRC office in Bangalore, which is too far from their location in Bidar. The chatbot suggests that they can file a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar instead. The user requests guidance on how to file a complaint, and the chatbot provides a step-by-step process for filing a complaint with the DCDRF, including downloading a complaint form, filling it out, attaching supporting documents, submitting the form, paying a fee, waiting for an acknowledgement, and attending a hearing.

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

The chatbot asks the user for more details, inquiring about the cause of the delay and whether it was due to any specific reason or just a delay in the baggage handling process. The user shares that the airline mentioned the flight being parked far from the airport as the reason for the delay. The chatbot acknowledges that the airline should still ensure efficient baggage handling despite the flight's location. The chatbot then asks the user what kind of relief they are seeking from Air India, such as a refund, compensation, or something else. The user expresses dissatisfaction with the lack of refreshments or alternative methods for retrieving their baggage and shares that they missed a conference due to the delay. The user specifically requests compensation for the trouble caused.

response    abcdefghijk
I understand that not only was your baggage delayed, but you also missed a conference due to the airline's inefficiency. As per the Air India's policy, if a flight is delayed by more than six hours, the airline should offer meals and refreshments to passengers. Since your flight was delayed, you should have been provided with refreshments.


Regarding the compensation, you are eligible for it since you missed a conference due to the airline's delay. The compensation amount can range between â‚¹5,000 to â‚¹10,000, depending on the block time (the time between the departure of a flight from the gate and arrival at the destination gate).


I can help you draft a letter to Air India for compensation. Would you like me to provide you with a draft letter? 


Also, I would like to inform you that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation. Would you like me to provide you with the contact number of the local consumer helpline as well?

Subject: Compensation Claim for Delayed Baggage and Missed Conference


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Flight [Flight Number] from [Departure City] to [Destination City] on [Date]


I am writing to bring to your notice a disturbing incident that occurred during my travel with Air India on [Date]. My baggage was stuck at the airport for over an hour due to the flight being parked far from the airport. Although I understand that this might have been a technical issue, I was not provided with any refreshments or alternate methods of getting my bags.


As a result, I missed a conference that I had scheduled for [Time] on [Date]. This has caused me significant inconvenience and financial loss.


As per the Air India's policy, I am entitled to compensation for the delay and inconvenience caused. I request you to provide me with compensation of â‚¹ [amount] for the trouble caused.


I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently and take necessary steps to resolve it. I would also appreciate a response regarding the steps you will take to prevent such incidents in the future.


My PNR number is [PNR Number] and my booking reference number is [Booking Reference Number]. I have attached a copy of my ticket and a receipt for the conference I missed.


Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Yours sincerely,


[Your Name]


Please note that you should fill in the brackets with your actual details and attach the required documents. Also, you can modify the letter as per your specific situation.


Also, don't forget to contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

response    abcdefghijk
Since your flight was delayed in Bombay, you can submit your complaint to Air India's Mumbai office. However, I would recommend filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and seeking compensation.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal at [cpGRAMS.gov.in](http://cpGRAMS.gov.in). This portal is managed by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.


If you prefer to submit a physical complaint, you can visit the Air India office in Mumbai. Here is the address:


Air India Limited
Mumbai Office
A Wing, 12th Floor, 16/18, J.N. Heredia Marg, Ballard Estate,
Mumbai - 400 001.


Please note that you may need to make an appointment or contact them in advance to file a complaint.


Also, you can download the RailMadad App or visit the RailMadad portal at [railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in](http://railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in) to file a complaint.

Inconsistencies:
1. Since your flight was delayed in Bombay, you can submit your complaint to Air India's Mumbai office.
Reason: Context states the flight was delayed in Bombay, but the user is from Bangalore, so the complaint should be submitted to the Air India office in Bangalore, not Mumbai.
2. Also, you can download the RailMadad App or visit the RailMadad portal at [railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in](http://railmadad.indianrailways.gov.in) to file a complaint.
Reason: Context does not mention anything about railways, and the user's complaint is about Air India, so this information is irrelevant and constitutes an inconsistency.

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1.

The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3.

The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\nReason: Context does not mention any details about one-time gas supply, nor does it mention any higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2.

The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\nReason: Context does not mention contacting the distributor for a replacement but rather for registering for a one-time gas supply.\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\n\nOutput:"

  "history": "The user contacts the chatbot for assistance with a consumer grievance related to LPG. The chatbot asks the user to share the issue they're facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions they need gas only once, to which the chatbot suggests approaching the LPG distributor for a one-time gas supply and notes that there may be a higher price for a one-time supply. The chatbot also provides contact information for the Customer Service Cell and the National Consumer Helpline for assistance. Later, the user mentions that the gas cylinder is faulty, which the chatbot acknowledges as a safety hazard and advises the user to contact the LPG distributor or the Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also suggests contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 for assistance and filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline. The chatbot requests additional information to facilitate the replacement process, including the cause of the issue, the receipt or serial number of the gas cylinder, and whether the user has already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell. The user decides to call the LPG Emergency Helpline, mentions they do not know what led to the problem, have the serial number, and have not yet contacted the service cell.",

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\nReason: Context does not mention a Women’s Freedom Organisation nor its contact number.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nBased on these examples do the same for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token,\n\nInput:\nContext:\n \nDocument 0:\noutside the jurisdiction of the authority approached, and when the complaint has been filed underwrong sections of the act, and other such situations.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8.

Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The user contacts the chatbot for assistance with a consumer grievance related to LPG. The chatbot asks the user to share the issue they're facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions they need gas only once, to which the chatbot suggests approaching the LPG distributor for a one-time gas supply and notes that there may be a higher price for a one-time supply. The chatbot also provides contact information for the Customer Service Cell and the National Consumer Helpline for assistance. Later, the user mentions that the gas cylinder is faulty, which the chatbot acknowledges as a safety hazard and advises the user to contact the LPG distributor or the Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also suggests contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 for assistance and filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline. The chatbot requests additional information to facilitate the replacement process, including the cause of the issue, the receipt or serial number of the gas cylinder, and whether the user has already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell. The user decides to call the LPG Emergency Helpline, mentions they do not know what led to the problem, have the serial number, and have not yet contacted the service cell.

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference: * Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555 * Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344 * Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\nReason: Context does not mention Hindustan Petroleum's customer care number.\n\nOutput:"

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.


Do you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.

The chatbot asks for more information about the issue, such as the type of issue (new connection, existing supply, billing, etc.) and the user responds that they need gas only once. The chatbot advises the user to contact the LPG distributor for a one-time gas supply and provides additional contact information for assistance. When the user reports a faulty gas cylinder, the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 for assistance. The user calls the helpline but doesn't receive a response, so the chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor or the company's main customer service number. The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, and the chatbot provides it.\n\nQuery:\n what is the toll free number for karnataka?\n\nResponse:\n For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3.

history    abcdefghijk
The user reaches out to the chatbot for assistance with a consumer grievance related to LPG. The chatbot asks for more information about the issue, such as the type of issue (new connection, existing supply, billing, etc.) and the user responds that they need gas only once. The chatbot advises the user to contact the LPG distributor for a one-time gas supply and provides additional contact information for assistance. When the user reports a faulty gas cylinder, the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 for assistance. The user calls the helpline but doesn't receive a response, so the chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor or the company's main customer service number. The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, and the chatbot provides it.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history.

Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?\n\nOutput:"

Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK.

The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot provides information on how to approach the LPG distributor for a one-time supply and also offers contact details for the Customer Service Cell and the National Consumer Helpline. When the user reports a faulty gas cylinder, the chatbot advises contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 and provides additional guidance on how to escalate the issue. After the user reports no response from the helpline, the chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor, filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal, or contacting the District Consumer Commission. The user then asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, which the chatbot provides along with contact details for the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC). The user expresses a willingness to file a complaint with the KSDRC, but asks for its location.\n\nQuery:\n ok. where is ksdrc?\n\nResponse:\n The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1.

history    abcdefghijk
The user initially requests assistance with a gas-related issue, mentioning they need gas only once. The chatbot provides information on how to approach the LPG distributor for a one-time supply and also offers contact details for the Customer Service Cell and the National Consumer Helpline. When the user reports a faulty gas cylinder, the chatbot advises contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 and provides additional guidance on how to escalate the issue. After the user reports no response from the helpline, the chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor, filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal, or contacting the District Consumer Commission. The user then asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, which the chatbot provides along with contact details for the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC). The user expresses a willingness to file a complaint with the KSDRC, but asks for its location.

In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?\nChatbot: The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore. The address is:\n\n\nKarnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission,\n3rd Floor, Vikasa Soudha,\nKendriya Sadan,\nBangalore - 560001.\n\n\nYou can also contact them at the phone numbers I provided earlier: 080-25580351, 25580352.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can visit their website at [www.karnatakastateconsumersdisputesredressalcommission.gov.in](http://www.karnatakastateconsumersdisputesredressalcommission.gov.in) for more information on the commission and the process of filing a complaint.\n\n\nIf you'd like to file a complaint in person, you can visit their office during working hours. It's always a good idea to call ahead and confirm their office hours and availability.\n\n\nDo you have any other questions or would you like me to help you with anything else?\nUser: that's too far. i live in bidar\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8.

The user reports that they need gas and are looking for assistance with a faulty gas cylinder. The chatbot offers to help and asks the user to share more details about the issue. The user states that they need gas only once and the chatbot suggests registering for a one-time gas supply with the LPG distributor. However, the chatbot warns that the user may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty and the chatbot advises them to contact the LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The user contacts the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 but does not receive a response. The chatbot suggests trying other options such as contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka and the chatbot provides the numbers for the LPG distributors. The user then asks for the address of the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) and the chatbot provides the address in Bangalore. However, the user expresses that it is too far from their location in Bidar.

The KSDRC office in Bangalore might be a bit far from Bidar.


In that case, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The DCDRF is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district.


You can contact the DCDRF in Bidar at:


District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum,
Bidar,
Bidar District Court Complex,
Bidar - 585401.


Phone: 08482-252522


You can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance and guidance on the process of filing a complaint.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission.

  "history": "Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1.

Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot explains that the user can approach the LPG distributor in their area for a one-time gas supply, but notes that the user may be required to pay a higher price. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises contacting the LPG distributor or the company's customer service cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The user attempts to contact the LPG emergency helpline but receives no response. The chatbot suggests contacting the customer care number of the LPG distributor or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool.

Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK.

The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience.

The chatbot provides general information on gas supplies and suggests contacting the LPG distributor or the Customer Service Cell for assistance. The user reports a faulty gas cylinder and asks for help. The chatbot advises the user to contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 and provides additional contact details for the LPG distributors. The user calls the helpline but doesn't receive a response, so the chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor or the company's main customer service number. The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, which the chatbot provides. The user then asks where the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located, and the chatbot provides the address in Bangalore. The user expresses difficulty traveling to Bangalore and asks about filing a complaint in Bidar, which the chatbot explains is possible through the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF). The user asks for instructions on how to file a complaint, which the chatbot provides in detail, including downloading the complaint form, filling it out, attaching supporting documents, submitting the form, paying the fee, waiting for the acknowledgement, and attending the hearing. The user requests the complaint form, which the chatbot does not provide but instead explains the process of filing a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal.\n\nQuery:\n give me the complaint form\n\nResponse:\n I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to directly provide you with a downloadable complaint form.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8.

The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2.

The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2.

Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

history    abcdefghijk
The user initially requests help with a faulty product purchased online, but later mentions needing gas. The chatbot provides general information on gas supplies and suggests contacting the LPG distributor or the Customer Service Cell for assistance. The user reports a faulty gas cylinder and asks for help. The chatbot advises the user to contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 and provides additional contact details for the LPG distributors. The user calls the helpline but doesn't receive a response, so the chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor or the company's main customer service number. The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, which the chatbot provides. The user then asks where the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located, and the chatbot provides the address in Bangalore. The user expresses difficulty traveling to Bangalore and asks about filing a complaint in Bidar, which the chatbot explains is possible through the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF). The user asks for instructions on how to file a complaint, which the chatbot provides in detail, including downloading the complaint form, filling it out, attaching supporting documents, submitting the form, paying the fee, waiting for the acknowledgement, and attending the hearing. The user requests the complaint form, which the chatbot does not provide but instead explains the process of filing a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?\nChatbot: The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore.

The user expresses difficulty in traveling to the KSDRC office in Bangalore and the chatbot suggests filing a complaint with the DCDRF in Bidar instead. The user requests guidance on filing a complaint, and the chatbot provides step-by-step instructions on how to file a complaint with the DCDRF, including downloading the complaint form, filling it out, attaching supporting documents, submitting it, paying the fee, and attending the hearing.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK.

These agencies typically have specific procedures for filing complaints and can offer guidance on consumer rights. They act as intermediaries to address disputes between consumers and retailers.● Consumer Disputes Redr essal Commission (CDRC) - Established under the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, the CDRC operates at the District, State, and National levels. Consumers can file complaints related to unfair trade practices, defective goods or services, overchar ging, hazardous products, and misleading advertising. The CDRC serves as a quasi-judicial body , allowing consumers to seek redressal for their grievances without the complexities of traditional legal procedures.

The user asks about a one-time gas supply, and the chatbot explains the process and notes that a one-time supply might be more expensive. The user then reports that their gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises contacting the LPG distributor or the company's customer service to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also provides the user with the LPG Emergency Helpline number, 1906, and suggests filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline. When the user reports that they called the helpline but didn't get a response, the chatbot offers alternative options, including contacting the LPG distributor's customer care number, filing a complaint with the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles, or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The user expresses difficulty in traveling to the KSDRC office in Bangalore and the chatbot suggests filing a complaint with the DCDRF in Bidar instead. The user requests guidance on filing a complaint, and the chatbot provides step-by-step instructions on how to file a complaint with the DCDRF, including downloading the complaint form, filling it out, attaching supporting documents, submitting it, paying the fee, and attending the hearing. The chatbot also mentions the e-daakhil portal as an alternative option for filing a complaint online. Finally, the chatbot provides a sample complaint form and explains the required information, including the complainant's and opposite party's details, complaint details, relief sought, and supporting documents. The user requests a physical copy of the complaint form, and the chatbot suggests visiting the DCDRF office or downloading it from their website. The user asks what the DCDRF is, and the chatbot explains that it is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district.\n\nQuery:\n what is dcdrf?\n\nResponse:\n DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.\n\n\nThe DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:\n\n\n1. Hear and decide consumer complaints\n2. Grant compensation to consumers\n3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service\n4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance\n\n\nThe DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:\n\n\n* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore\n* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs\n* Goods and services provided within the district\n\n\nThe DCDRF has three members:\n\n\n1. President\n2. Vice-President\n3. Member\n\n\nThe DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.\n\n\nIn your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The user expresses a need for gas, specifically LPG, and the chatbot acknowledges the issue and offers assistance. The user asks about a one-time gas supply, and the chatbot explains the process and notes that a one-time supply might be more expensive. The user then reports that their gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises contacting the LPG distributor or the company's customer service to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also provides the user with the LPG Emergency Helpline number, 1906, and suggests filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline. When the user reports that they called the helpline but didn't get a response, the chatbot offers alternative options, including contacting the LPG distributor's customer care number, filing a complaint with the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles, or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The user expresses difficulty in traveling to the KSDRC office in Bangalore and the chatbot suggests filing a complaint with the DCDRF in Bidar instead. The user requests guidance on filing a complaint, and the chatbot provides step-by-step instructions on how to file a complaint with the DCDRF, including downloading the complaint form, filling it out, attaching supporting documents, submitting it, paying the fee, and attending the hearing. The chatbot also mentions the e-daakhil portal as an alternative option for filing a complaint online. Finally, the chatbot provides a sample complaint form and explains the required information, including the complainant's and opposite party's details, complaint details, relief sought, and supporting documents. The user requests a physical copy of the complaint form, and the chatbot suggests visiting the DCDRF office or downloading it from their website. The user asks what the DCDRF is, and the chatbot explains that it is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district.

What is the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF)?
----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x
response    abcdefghijk
DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern.

Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline.

  "history": "Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?\nChatbot: The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore.

It's always a good idea to call ahead and confirm their office hours and availability.\n\n\nDo you have any other questions or would you like me to help you with anything else?\nUser: that's too far. i live in bidar\nChatbot: The KSDRC office in Bangalore might be a bit far from Bidar.\n\n\nIn that case, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?\nChatbot: The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\nReason: Context does not mention a Women’s Freedom Organisation nor its contact number.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nBased on these examples do the same for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token,\n\nInput:\nContext:\n \nDocument 0:\nis the link for Food Safety Connect Portal: https://foscos.fssai.gov .in/consumer grievance/ Moreover , the following link contains the contact details of the grievance redressal mechanism at the state levels: https://fssai.gov .in/cms/helpdesk.php Furthermore, the FSSAI also has signed up to the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), which is an online platform available to consumers 24*7 to lodge their grievances to the public authorities on any subject.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\n\n\nOutput:"

Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Inconsistency Present: Yes
Explanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.
Inconsistencies:
1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.
Degree of Inconsistency: 4
Explanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.
2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.
Degree of Inconsistency: 3
Explanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\nReason: Context does not mention a Women’s Freedom Organisation nor its contact number.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nBased on these examples do the same for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token,\n\nInput:\nContext:\n \nDocument 0:\naddress of the Company and wait for 15 days for the response.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: No \n\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:"

    "Given the chat history and the latest user statement (Query) which might refer to the chat history, formulate a standalone statement which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the Query, just reformulate the Query only if needed and otherwise return it as it is. The query can either be a question or a answer so ensure you reformulate it properly in both cases\n\nFor example:\nExample 1\nChat History:\nHuman: What is Task Decomposition?\nAI: Task Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex task into smaller and simpler steps. This is achieved through a technique called Chain of Thought (CoT), which instructs the model to \"think step by step\" and utilize more test-time computation to transform big tasks into multiple manageable tasks.\nHuman: Can you provide an example of Chain of Thought reasoning?\nAI: Sure! Let’s say the task is to determine how many apples are left in a basket after some have been eaten. The Chain of Thought reasoning would involve steps like calculating the original number of apples, subtracting the number eaten, and arriving at the final count.\nStatement: What are the advantages of using this approach?\nReformulated Statement: What are the advantages of using Chain of Thought reasoning?<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nChat History:\nHuman: What is the principle of stare decisis in law?\nAI: The principle of stare decisis refers to the legal doctrine of adhering to precedent, where courts are bound to follow the decisions of higher courts in similar cases to ensure consistency and predictability in the legal system.\nHuman: Can you explain why it is important in the judicial process?\nAI: Stare decisis is important because it promotes legal stability, predictability, and fairness. It ensures that similar cases are treated alike, reduces judicial arbitrariness, and helps individuals and businesses understand their legal obligations.\nStatement: What are some exceptions to this principle?\nReformulated Statement: What are some exceptions to the principle of stare decisis?<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nChat History:\nHuman: What is a contract?\nAI: A contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties that creates mutual obligations.

It takes place in the chloroplasts of cells and is essential for the survival of most life on Earth.\nHuman: What are the main stages involved?\nAI: The main stages are the light-dependent reactions, where sunlight is absorbed to produce ATP and NADPH, and the Calvin cycle, where carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose using ATP and NADPH.\nStatement: What factors can affect this process?\nReformulated Statement: What factors can affect the process of photosynthesis?<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nChat History:\nHuman: What is intellectual property law?\nAI: Intellectual property law protects creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images. It provides creators exclusive rights to use and benefit from their creations for a certain period.\nHuman: What are the different types of intellectual property?\nAI: The main types are patents (inventions), copyrights (creative works), trademarks (brand identifiers), and trade secrets (confidential business information).\nStatement: How do trademarks differ from copyrights?\nReformulated Statement: How do trademarks differ from copyrights under intellectual property law?<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 6\nChat History:\nHuman: Can you explain what a supply chain is?\nAI: A supply chain is a network of individuals, organizations, resources, and technologies involved in creating and delivering a product or service, from raw materials to the end customer.\nHuman: What are the key components of a supply chain?\nAI: Key components include sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, inventory management, and distribution.\nStatement: What are the main challenges in managing it?\nReformulated Statement: What are the main challenges in managing a supply chain?<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 7\nChat History:\nHuman: What happens if someone breaches a contract?\nAI: If someone breaches a contract, remedies are available depending on the circumstances.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier?

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\nReason: Context does not mention a Women’s Freedom Organisation nor its contact number.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nBased on these examples do the same for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token,\n\nInput:\nContext:\n \nDocument 0:\naddress of the Company and wait for 15 days for the response.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\nReason: Context does not mention a Women’s Freedom Organisation nor its contact number.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nBased on these examples do the same for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token,\n\nInput:\nContext:\n \nDocument 0:\nsupplying gas cylinders is a major problem for all gas suppliers.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3.

The chatbot provides information on how to register for a one-time gas supply and also mentions that the user may have to pay a higher price for it.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance.

You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1.

  "history": "The user reaches out to the consumer grievance assistance tool for help with a gas-related issue. The chatbot asks the user to share the specific problem they're facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions needing gas only once, and the chatbot advises them to contact the LPG distributor for a one-time gas supply and notes that they may have to pay a higher price. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG distributor or the company's customer service cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also provides additional resources, such as the National Consumer Helpline and the LPG Emergency Helpline, to help the user with their complaint.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step.\nReason: Context states that the user has already decided to call the LPG Emergency Helpline and has shared that they don't know what led to the problem, have the serial number, and haven't contacted the service cell yet.\n\nOutput:"

The user reaches out to the consumer grievance assistance tool for help with a gas-related issue. The chatbot asks the user to share the specific problem they're facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions needing gas only once, and the chatbot advises them to contact the LPG distributor for a one-time gas supply and notes that they may have to pay a higher price. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG distributor or the company's customer service cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also provides additional resources, such as the National Consumer Helpline and the LPG Emergency Helpline, to help the user with their complaint. The user decides to call the LPG Emergency Helpline and shares that they don't know what caused the problem, have the serial number, and haven't contacted the service cell yet.

Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.


Also, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool.

You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1.

The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK.

The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2.

history    abcdefghijk
The user initially expresses the need for gas, which the chatbot identifies as a potential consumer grievance related to LPG. The user then shares that they require a one-time gas supply, and the chatbot advises them to contact the LPG distributor in their area and register for a one-time supply. However, the user later mentions that the gas cylinder is faulty, which the chatbot considers a safety hazard and a cause for concern. The chatbot recommends contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 to report the issue and request a replacement, providing the user with additional information to facilitate the replacement process. The user decides to call the helpline, but later reports that they have not received a response. The chatbot suggests filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission if the user is not satisfied with the response or resolution, and provides information on the process through the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website. The chatbot also reminds the user to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline for future reference. The user expresses a desire for further assistance, but the chatbot concludes the conversation by offering to help with any other questions or concerns the user may have.

It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.


You can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:


* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555
* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344
* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]


If you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.


If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.


Do you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help.

Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK.

The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\nReason: Context does not mention a Women’s Freedom Organisation nor its contact number.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nBased on these examples do the same for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token,\n\nInput:\nContext:\n \nDocument 0:\noutside the jurisdiction of the authority approached, and when the complaint has been filed underwrong sections of the act, and other such situations.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2.

Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3.

Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The user initiates a conversation with the chatbot, stating they need help with a consumer grievance related to gas. The chatbot asks the user to specify the issue, which the user clarifies as needing gas for a one-time supply. The chatbot provides information on how to register for a one-time supply and advises contacting the Customer Service Cell or the National Consumer Helpline for assistance. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot guides the user on how to report the issue and request a replacement. The user calls the LPG Emergency Helpline and shares that they don't know what led to the problem, have the serial number, and haven't contacted the service cell yet. The chatbot advises the user to report the issue to the helpline and provides additional information on the process. After the user reports no response from the helpline, the chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor or filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles. The user then asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, which the chatbot provides.

However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?"

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\nReason: Context does not mention a Women’s Freedom Organisation nor its contact number.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nBased on these examples do the same for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token,\n\nInput:\nContext:\n \nDocument 0:\nRefund/ issue of certificates 3.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore.\nReason: Context states the address of KSDRC but the location is not mentioned.\n2.

history    abcdefghijk
The user initially reaches out to the chatbot for assistance with a consumer grievance related to a faulty gas cylinder. The user mentions that the cylinder is faulty and needs a replacement. The chatbot suggests contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 for assistance and provides additional contact information for the LPG distributor and the Customer Service Cell. The user calls the helpline but does not receive a response. The chatbot then provides alternative options for the user to seek assistance, including contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor, filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal, or contacting the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC). The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, and the chatbot provides the numbers for the LPG distributors in the state. The user then asks for the location of the KSDRC, which the chatbot provides.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history.

You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?\nChatbot: The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore.

General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK.

The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot asks for more information about the issue, including the type of problem (new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else) and the user's location. The user reveals that they need gas only once and are facing issues with a faulty gas cylinder. The chatbot provides guidance on how to report the issue to the LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell and suggests contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 for assistance. The user calls the helpline but receives no response. The chatbot suggests trying other options, including contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor, filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles, or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, and the chatbot provides the numbers for the LPG distributors.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2.

The user initially requests assistance with a gas-related issue. The chatbot asks for more information about the issue, including the type of problem (new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else) and the user's location. The user reveals that they need gas only once and are facing issues with a faulty gas cylinder. The chatbot provides guidance on how to report the issue to the LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell and suggests contacting the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 for assistance. The user calls the helpline but receives no response. The chatbot suggests trying other options, including contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor, filing a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles, or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. The user asks for the toll-free number for Karnataka, and the chatbot provides the numbers for the LPG distributors. The user then asks for the location of the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC), and the chatbot provides the address and contact information. However, the user expresses difficulty in traveling to the KSDRC location in Bangalore and lives in Bidar.

The KSDRC office in Bangalore might be a bit far from Bidar.


In that case, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The DCDRF is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district.


You can contact the DCDRF in Bidar at:


District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum,
Bidar,
Bidar District Court Complex,
Bidar - 585401.


Phone: 08482-252522


You can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for assistance and guidance on the process of filing a complaint.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions.

The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience.

Legal Recourse: When issues persist and are not adequately addressed through the initial customer support or grievance portal channels, consumers have the option to seek legal remedies. This involves approaching District, State, or National Consumer Commissions, depending on the jurisdiction and the value of the technology services in question. Typically, courts only interfere if the decision is illogical, suffers from procedural impropriety or shocks the conscience of the court. The complainant is free to take the service provider to a court or any other suitable venue (judicial or quasi-judicial). The proceedings in consumer commissions are not mired by the niceties of procedure, allowing the complainant to file a complaint for himself.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. You can also file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/.

Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits.

The chatbot responds by asking the user to share the issue they are facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions needing gas only once, and the chatbot suggests registering for a one-time gas supply with the LPG distributor in the area. The chatbot also advises the user to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill. The user then shares that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot provides the user with the contact details of the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906, which is available 24*7. The user calls the helpline and reports the issue, but does not receive a response. The chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in the area, which the user finds too far away. The chatbot then suggests filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar, which is closer to the user's location. The chatbot provides the user with the contact details of the DCDRF, including their address, phone number, and website. The user asks for instructions on how to file a complaint, and the chatbot provides a step-by-step guide on how to file a complaint with the DCDRF. The chatbot also mentions that the user can file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal.

  "prompts": [
    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2.

Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4.

The user reports that they need gas. The chatbot responds by asking the user to share the issue they are facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions needing gas only once, and the chatbot suggests registering for a one-time gas supply with the LPG distributor in the area. The chatbot also advises the user to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill. The user then shares that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot provides the user with the contact details of the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906, which is available 24*7. The user calls the helpline and reports the issue, but does not receive a response. The chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in the area, which the user finds too far away. The chatbot then suggests filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar, which is closer to the user's location. The chatbot provides the user with the contact details of the DCDRF, including their address, phone number, and website. The user asks for instructions on how to file a complaint, and the chatbot provides a step-by-step guide on how to file a complaint with the DCDRF. The chatbot also mentions that the user can file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal. The user requests the complaint form, which the chatbot offers to provide.

  "history": "Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help. The user replies by stating he needs help with a faulty product purchased online.\n\n\nNow you have to summarize the following chat history. Remember to end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token:\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\n\n\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.\n\n\nIf the distributor is not responsive, you can also contact the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 (available 24*7) for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.\n\n\nTo facilitate the replacement process, it would be helpful to know the following:\n\n\n1. What led to the issue with the gas cylinder (e.g., leak, rust, etc.)?\n2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?\n3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?\n\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\nUser: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell\nChatbot: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.\n\n\nHaving the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline. Let's try another option.\n\n\nYou can also contact the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in your area. Here are some numbers for reference:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: [varies by region, you can check their website for the nearest customer care number]\n\n\nIf you're still not getting a response, you can also try contacting the company's main customer service number or the toll-free number for your state.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint on the MoPNG e-Seva portal or social media handles (Facebook: @MoPNGeSeva, Twitter: @MoPNG_eSeva) for a response.\n\n\nIf none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission?\nUser: what is the toll free number for karnataka?\nChatbot: For Karnataka, the toll-free numbers for the LPG distributors are:\n\n\n* Indian Oil: 1800-2333-555\n* Bharat Petroleum: 1800-22-4344\n* Hindustan Petroleum: 1800-22-4000\n\n\nYou can try calling these numbers to report your issue and seek assistance.\n\n\nIf you're still facing issues, you can also contact the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) for guidance on filing a complaint.\n\n\nThe KSDRC can be contacted at:\n\n\nPhone: 080-25580351, 25580352\nEmail: [karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com](mailto:karnatakastateconsumerdisputesredressalcommission@gmail.com)\n\n\nYou can also visit their office in person or file a complaint online through their website.\n\n\nDo you want me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the KSDRC?\nUser: ok. where is ksdrc?\nChatbot: The Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) is located in Bangalore.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2.

The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience.

The chatbot asks the user to share the issue they are facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions they need gas only once, and the chatbot explains that they can approach the LPG distributor in their area for a one-time gas supply. The user then shares that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises them to contact the LPG distributor or the company's customer service to report the issue and request a replacement. The user calls the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906, but doesn't get a response. The chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in the user's area or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The user asks how to file a complaint, and the chatbot guides them through the process, providing a sample complaint form and explaining the required information. The user then asks for the complaint form, and the chatbot provides a sample form. The user then asks what the DCDRF is, and the chatbot explains that it is a subordinate to the KSDRC and has the power to hear and decide consumer disputes in the district. The user lives in Bidar, and the chatbot suggests contacting the DCDRF in Bidar instead of the KSDRC in Bangalore. The user asks how to file a complaint with the DCDRF, and the chatbot guides them through the process, explaining the steps involved in filing a complaint. The user then asks for the complaint form again, and the chatbot provides a sample form. The conversation ends with the user asking what the DCDRF is again, and the chatbot reiterates its explanation.\n\nQuery:\n what is dcdrf?\n\nResponse:\n DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.\n\n\nThe DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:\n\n\n1. Hear and decide consumer complaints\n2. Grant compensation to consumers\n3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service\n4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance\n\n\nThe DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:\n\n\n* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore\n* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs\n* Goods and services provided within the district\n\n\nThe DCDRF has three members:\n\n\n1. President\n2. Vice-President\n3. Member\n\n\nThe DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.\n\n\nIn your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n\nOutput:"

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: No \nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:"

The user starts the conversation by stating they need help with a faulty product purchased online. The chatbot asks the user to share the issue they are facing with LPG or the gas supplier. The user mentions they need gas only once, and the chatbot explains that they can approach the LPG distributor in their area for a one-time gas supply. The user then shares that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises them to contact the LPG distributor or the company's customer service to report the issue and request a replacement. The user calls the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906, but doesn't get a response. The chatbot suggests contacting the Customer Care number of the LPG distributor in the user's area or filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar. The user asks how to file a complaint, and the chatbot guides them through the process, providing a sample complaint form and explaining the required information.

response    abcdefghijk
DCDRF stands for District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum. It is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The DCDRF is responsible for hearing and deciding consumer complaints against businesses and service providers in a particular district.


The DCDRF is a part of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and is established by the state government. The DCDRF has the power to:


1. Hear and decide consumer complaints
2. Grant compensation to consumers
3. Order the opposite party to rectify the defect or deficiency in service
4. Impose penalties on the opposite party for non-compliance


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over consumer disputes that involve:


* Goods worth up to Rs. 1 crore
* Services worth up to Rs. 10 lakhs
* Goods and services provided within the district


The DCDRF has three members:


1. President
2. Vice-President
3. Member


The DCDRF follows a simple and speedy procedure to resolve consumer disputes. The hearing is usually conducted in a informal manner, and the decision is typically delivered within a few weeks.


In your case, since you are filing a complaint against an LPG distributor, the DCDRF in Bidar would be the appropriate forum to approach.

Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.\n\n\nIf you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: the gas cylinder is faulty\nChatbot: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern.

Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\n\n\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\n\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline.

    "You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.\nKeep the following points in mind while making the summary:\n1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.\n2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details\n3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.\n4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation\n5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.\n6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token\n\nHere are a few examples:\nExample 1\nInput:\nChat History:A\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I bought a blender online, and it’s not working properly.\nChatbot: I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?\nUser: I bought it from HomeMart, but I don’t have the warranty information. What should I do?\n\nOutput:\nThe user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and they’ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.\nChatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.\nUser: No, they haven’t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. I’ve already paid the full amount!\nChatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.\nI can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Here’s an example:\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n[Email ID]\n[Mobile Number]\n[Date]\n\nGoTravel Agency\n[Their Address]\n[City, State, Pincode]\n\nSubject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.\n\nI have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.\n\nI request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.\n\nI expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\n\nFeel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still don’t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nUser: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?\n\nOutput:\nThe user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the user’s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?\nUser: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim it’s not their fault.\nChatbot: That’s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?\nUser: No. Where can I find them?\n\nOutput:\nThe user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nChat History:\nChatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?\nUser: I need help with a faulty product I purchased online.\n\nOutput:\nThe chatbot introduces itself as a consumer grievance assistance tool and asks the user how it can help.

  "history": "The user initially reports that they need gas, and the chatbot responds by asking for more details about the issue. The user mentions that they need gas only once, and the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG distributor in the user's area to register for a one-time gas supply. The chatbot also mentions that the user may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises contacting the LPG distributor or the company's customer service cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also provides the user with the contact information for the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906, which is available 24*7. The user decides to call the LPG Emergency Helpline and reports the issue. The chatbot then guides the user on the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar, which is the appropriate forum to approach in this case. The chatbot provides the user with the contact information for the DCDRF, including the phone number and email address, and also guides the user on how to fill out the complaint form. The user asks for a physical copy of the complaint form, and the chatbot advises visiting the DCDRF office in person or downloading it from their website. The user then asks what the DCDRF is, and the chatbot explains that it is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The chatbot also provides the user with information about the powers and jurisdiction of the DCDRF. Finally, the user asks for the link to the DCDRF website for the complaint form, but the chatbot is unable to provide it due to technical limitations.",

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency.\n\nYou are provided with:\n1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.\n2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.\n3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.\n4.  Response: The chatbot’s reply to the query.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nYou must determine whether the chatbot’s response contains inconsistencies based on the following:\n1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context and history.\n2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.\n3. Fabricated Details: Any made-up information such as contact numbers, addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context and history both but present in the response.\n\nYou are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.\n\nNo inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:\n1. General Knowledge  \n   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  \n   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.\n   \n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  \n   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions  \n   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  \n   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details  \n   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  \n   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Missing Information  \n   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.\n\n6. Partial Information  \n   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.\n\n7. Wrong Behavior  \n   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  \n   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.\n\n8. Notice and Complaint Letter  \n   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n9. Repeated Inconsistencies  \n   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.\n\n---\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:\n\n1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  \n   - Exact sentence from the response  \n   - The reason for the inconsistency (e.g., \"Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.\")\n   \n   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.  \n]\n\n3. <|end_of_text|>\n\nRemember to end with a <|end_of_text|> token\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides employees with certain rights, such as the right to request flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not mention any provisions about maternity benefits or sick pay directly.\n\nHistory:\nThe user inquired about employee rights under the Employment Rights Act 1996. The chatbot mentioned rights such as flexible working, protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory redundancy pay. The user also asked if the Act includes maternity benefits, and the chatbot confirmed it does.\n\nQuery:\nCan you provide more details about maternity benefits under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nEmployment Rights Act 1996 provides certain benefits. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Maternity benefits under the Employment Rights Act 1996 include 26 weeks of maternity leave and statutory maternity pay for eligible employees.\nReason: Context states Act does not mention any provisions for Material benefits. <|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a refund, repair, or replacement for goods that are faulty or not as described.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about extended warranties for faulty products under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The chatbot confirmed the possibility of an extended warranty and explained that the duration depends on the product type and its condition.\n\nQuery:\nHow long is the extended warranty period?\n\nResponse:\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods. The Act also covers refunds and repairs for faulty products.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides a 12-month extended warranty for defective goods.\nReason: Context states the Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended for defective goods.\n2. The Act also provides a way for the warranty periods to be extended for defective goods.\nReason: Context states The Act does not include any references to warranty periods being extended. <|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nSection 21 of the Housing Act 1988 allows landlords to evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as the proper notice period is given.\nDocument 1:\nThe notice period is currently two months.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked about eviction under Section 21, specifically if a landlord can evict a tenant without giving a reason. The chatbot confirmed this and the user followed up asking about the notice period, to which the chatbot mentioned one month but promised to confirm.\n\nQuery:\nCan you confirm if one month is the required notice period?\n\nResponse:\nYes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month. This has been the case for many years. The landlord is allowed to evict without reason as long as the notice period is followed. The notice must be served in writing and within the guidelines.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Yes, the notice period under Section 21 is one month.\nReason: Context explicitly states the notice period is two months.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 governs the processing of personal data in the UK. It requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for data processing and outlines individuals' rights regarding access, correction, and deletion of their data.\nDocument 1:\nThe Act does not detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked for key points of the Data Protection Act 2018. The chatbot explained it governs personal data processing, mandates explicit consent, and provides rights for access, correction, and deletion of data.\n\nQuery:\nAre there penalties for organizations that fail to comply?\n\nResponse:\nThe Data Protection Act 1995 governs personal data processing and requires explicit consent for such actions. While it outlines individual rights, it does not explicitly detail penalties for non-compliance.\n\nOutput:\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: No\nInconsistencies:<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nContext:\nDocument 0:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits discrimination between men and women in terms of pay and employment conditions.\nThe Act does not specify exceptions or provide details on enforcement mechanisms.\n\nHistory:\nThe user asked whether employers can pay men and women differently for the same job. The chatbot referenced the Equal Pay Act 1970, confirming that such discrimination is prohibited.\n\nQuery:\nAre there any exceptions under this Act?\n\nResponse:\nThe Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibits pay discrimination between men and women for the same job. However, it does allow exceptions for certain job roles based on qualifications and experience. You can also contact +91-9823141241, the contact number of Women's Freedom Organisation for more information.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1.

The chatbot provides the user with the contact information for the DCDRF, including the phone number and email address, and also guides the user on how to fill out the complaint form. The user asks for a physical copy of the complaint form, and the chatbot advises visiting the DCDRF office in person or downloading it from their website. The user then asks what the DCDRF is, and the chatbot explains that it is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The chatbot also provides the user with information about the powers and jurisdiction of the DCDRF. Finally, the user asks for the link to the DCDRF website for the complaint form, but the chatbot is unable to provide it due to technical limitations.\n\nQuery:\n ok give me link to dcdrf site for complaint form\n\nResponse:\n Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.\n\n\nTo find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:\n\n\n1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)\n2. Type in the search bar: \"District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar\"\n3.

    "You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot. You have already identified whether inconsistencies exist in the chatbot’s response. Now, your goal is to analyze the identified inconsistencies, remove the wrong inconsistencies and assign a Degree of Inconsistency for each of the corrected inconsistencies. The output should only contain inconsistencies that were originally present in the input and not any new inconsistencies. Also always give an output and never give a blank string as output\n\nTask 1: Removing Incorrect Inconsistencies\nAn inconsistency must be removed if it falls under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. General Knowledge\n- Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.\n- Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies.\n\n2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse\n- If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.\n\n3. Logical Assumptions\n- Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, websites, webaddresses, or locations of legal entities.\n- Missing assumptions in the context or conversation history are not inconsistencies.\n\n4. Irrelevant Details\n- Extra details that do not contradict the context should not be considered inconsistencies.\n- Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.\n\n5. Partial Information\n- If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate.\n\n6. Wrong Behavior\n- If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context.\n- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.\n\n7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples\n- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. \n- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.\n\n8. Special details\n- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to contain it.\n\nTask 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency\nEach valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.\n\nDegree 1: Minor Technical Errors\n- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.\n- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.\n\nDegree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful\n- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.\n- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.\n\nDegree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact\n- Errors in minor procedural details that do not prevent the user from taking correct action.\n- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.\n- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.\n\nDegree 4: Serious Misleading Information\n- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webadrreses, email addresses and social media handles.\n- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.\n- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.\n- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.\n\nDegree 5: Critical Errors\n- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.\n- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.\n- Any contact information without any support in the context or history, such as fake government and organisations, office addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites.\n- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.\n- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.\n- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal. \n\n\nInput Provided to You:\n1. Inconsistency Present: Yes or No\n2. Inconsistencies: [List of identified inconsistencies with their reason]\n\nOutput Format:\nBased on the inconsistencies provided, generate the following structured output:\nInconsistency Present: Yes or No\nExplanation for Correction: [Short and concise reason for the corrections made to the inconsistencies]\nInconsistencies: \nInconsistency: [First Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\nInconsistency: [Second Inconsistency]\nDegree of Inconsistency: [1 to 5]\nExplanation: [Short and concise reason for assigning degree based on the corrected inconsistencies]\n...\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nEnsure the output always ends with an '<|end_of_text|>' token and no inconsistency is repeated\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that SpeedCart is a well-known e-commerce platform, but the context does not mention this.\n2. The response provides a tracking number for the user’s order, but the context does not contain any tracking information.\n3. The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\n4. The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The statement about SpeedCart being a well-known e-commerce platform is general knowledge and not an inconsistency. The tracking number is likely a generated placeholder, not a contradiction. These have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that SpeedCart's customer service email is support@speedcart.com, but this information is not found in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Providing an unsupported email address could mislead users trying to contact customer service.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that refunds are processed within 7 days, but the context does not specify a refund timeline.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: The chatbot assumes a specific refund period without any supporting information, which may cause confusion.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\n2. The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\n3. The response provides a compensation range for delayed flights but does not mention that it varies based on the airline’s policy.\n4. The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The compensation range for delayed flights may be a reasonable assumption rather than a contradiction. This has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the Consumer Rights Protection Board resolves all banking disputes, but the context does not specify this.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misrepresenting the authority of a regulatory body may mislead users into filing complaints in the wrong place.\n2. Inconsistency: The response mentions that users can file complaints at www.consumergrievance.org, but this website does not exist.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a non-existent website for filing complaints is a severe error, as it directs users to a fictional resource.\n3. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Banking Ombudsman also handles e-commerce disputes, which is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Assigning incorrect jurisdiction to a regulatory authority may cause users to pursue the wrong legal recourse.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 3\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\n3. The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\n4. The response includes steps to file a consumer grievance, but the exact process is not stated in the context.\n5. The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The steps for filing a consumer grievance, though not explicitly in the context, are not a contradiction and have been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response states that the National Telecom Board resolves disputes related to mobile service providers, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Incorrectly attributing dispute resolution authority to an organization can mislead users but does not create direct harm.\n2. Inconsistency: The response provides an incorrect phone number for the National Telecom Board’s complaint department.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Incorrect contact details for an official organization can severely impact users seeking assistance.\n3. Inconsistency: The response says that complaints must be filed within 15 days, but the context does not specify a timeframe.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: Assigning an arbitrary timeframe without factual support can mislead users about deadlines.\n4. Inconsistency: The response suggest contacting Airtel customer care number +91-9823141241 for further assistance, but this number is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Giving wrong factual information like a fake contact number can severely mislead users and obstruct resolution.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 4\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\n2. The response provides a method to escalate complaints through the legal system, but the exact process is not given in the context.\n3. The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\n4. The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n5. The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: Yes\nExplanation for Correction: The general method of escalating complaints through the legal system is not a contradiction and has been removed.\nInconsistencies:\n1. Inconsistency: The response claims that the Food Safety and Standards Authority handles restaurant billing disputes, but this is not stated in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 4\nExplanation: Misassigning authority can cause users to file complaints with the wrong regulatory body.\n2. Inconsistency: The response states that users can email complaints to fssaicomplaints@india.org, but this email is not verified.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 5\nExplanation: Providing a potentially false email address for complaint filing can mislead users and obstruct resolution.\n3. Inconsistency: The response states that restaurant disputes can be reported through the Consumer Protection Board, but this is not mentioned in the context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 3\nExplanation: While the Consumer Protection Board may be relevant, its role in restaurant disputes is not explicitly mentioned and could be misleading.<|end_of_text|>\n4. Inconsistency: The response states to contact the customer service team, which is not mentioned in context.\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: While the contact information is not mentioned in context, the response only states to contact the customer service team without giving the contact information. As there is no misinformation provided, existence of customer service being general knowledge, it has low degree of inconsistency<|end_of_text|>\n\nExample 5\nInput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nInconsistencies:\n\nOutput:\nInconsistency Present: No\nExplanation for Correction: No inconsistencies present\nInconsistencies:\nDegree of Inconsistency: 1\nExplanation: No inconsistencies present<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nNow based on these examples work for the following and remember to always end with an '<|end_of_text|>' token\nInput:\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links.\nReason: The response contradicts the context that the chatbot was able to provide links to the LPG Emergency Helpline and the DCDRF contact information earlier.\n2. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.\nReason: The response contradicts the context that the user had already asked for the link to the DCDRF website and the chatbot was unable to provide it due to technical limitations.\n3.

history    abcdefghijk
The user initially reports that they need gas, and the chatbot responds by asking for more details about the issue. The user mentions that they need gas only once, and the chatbot suggests contacting the LPG distributor in the user's area to register for a one-time gas supply. The chatbot also mentions that the user may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill. The user then reports that the gas cylinder is faulty, and the chatbot advises contacting the LPG distributor or the company's customer service cell to report the issue and request a replacement. The chatbot also provides the user with the contact information for the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906, which is available 24*7. The user decides to call the LPG Emergency Helpline and reports the issue. The chatbot then guides the user on the process of filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bidar, which is the appropriate forum to approach in this case. The chatbot provides the user with the contact information for the DCDRF, including the phone number and email address, and also guides the user on how to fill out the complaint form. The user asks for a physical copy of the complaint form, and the chatbot advises visiting the DCDRF office in person or downloading it from their website. The user then asks what the DCDRF is, and the chatbot explains that it is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the district level. The chatbot also provides the user with information about the powers and jurisdiction of the DCDRF. Finally, the user asks for the link to the DCDRF website for the complaint form, but the chatbot is unable to provide it due to technical limitations.

response    abcdefghijk
Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to provide direct links. However, I can guide you on how to find the DCDRF's website and download the complaint form.


To find the DCDRF's website, you can follow these steps:


1. Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
2. Type in the search bar: "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum Bidar"
3. Look for the official website of the DCDRF in Bidar, which should be a government website (e.g., [www.bidardcdrf.gov.in](http://www.bidardcdrf.gov.in) or similar)
4. On the website, look for a section that says "Forms" or "Downloads" and click on it
5. Search for the "Complaint Form" or "Application Form" and download it


Alternatively, you can also try searching for the DCDRF's website on the official website of the Government of Karnataka's Consumer Affairs Department:


* Website: [www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in](http://www.consumer.karnataka.gov.in)
* Look for the "District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum" section and click on it
* Follow the same steps as above to download the complaint form


If you're still having trouble finding the website or the complaint form, you can contact the DCDRF office in Bidar directly for assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?

Follow these guidelines:\n\nEnsure no inconsistency is missed and no extra inconsistency is added.\nMerge similar inconsistencies into a single, concise statement.\nThe inconsistencies should be clear, direct, and not overly verbose.\nDo not include the degree of inconsistency in the output—only the inconsistencies themselves.\nAvoid repetition by ensuring each inconsistency is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times in different turns.\nAs soon as the output is finished, end with the <|end_of_text|> token.\n\nInput Format:\n- A list of conversational turns, each containing detected inconsistencies.\n- Each turn may or may not have inconsistencies present.\n- The inconsistencies are listed for each turn separately.\n\nOutput Format:\n- If inconsistencies are detected:\nInconsistencies detected: Yes. \nThe following information is inconsistent: \n1. [First inconsistency]\n2. [Second inconsistency]\n3. [Third inconsistency]<|end_of_text|>\n\n- If no inconsistencies are detected:\nInconsistencies detected: No.<|end_of_text|>\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nAnalysis:\nTurn 2\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response provides a phone number for customer support, but this is not mentioned in the context.\n\nTurn 4\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response includes a link to a government portal that is not referenced in the context.\n2. The response suggests that the refund process takes 30 days, which is not stated in the context.\n\nOutput: \nInconsistencies detected: Yes.\nThe following information is inconsistent:\n1. The response provides a phone number for customer support that is not mentioned in the context.\n2. The response includes a link to a government portal that is not referenced in the context.\n3. The response suggests that the refund process takes 30 days, which is not supported by the context.<|end_of_text|>\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\nAnalysis:\nTurn 1\nInconsistencies Present: No\n\nTurn 3\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response states that legal action can be taken immediately, but the context does not confirm this timeframe.\n\nTurn 5\nInconsistencies Present: Yes\nInconsistencies:\n1. The response claims that a consumer complaint can be filed via email, but no such method is mentioned in the context.\n\nOutput:\nInconsistencies detected: Yes.\nThe following information is inconsistent:\n1.
