It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?
