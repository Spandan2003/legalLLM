by   the   commission   on   a   case-by-case   basis.   Factors   considered   include   which   component   caused   the   defect   and   whether   proper   instructions   or   warnings   were   provided.   This   is   especially   relevant   for   products   like   home   appliances   and   automobiles   with   parts   from   different   manufacturers.   Courts   have   attempted   to   identify   the   responsible   party   in   past   cases   with   multiple   parties   involved.   If   assigning   liability   to   a   single   party   is   not   possible,   all   involved   parties   may   be   held   jointly   and   severally   liable.” — Question:   “Who   can   be   held   liable   for   a   misleading   advertisement?” Answer:   “Any   of   the   following   parties   can   be   held   liable   for   a   misleading   advertisement: 1.

Moreover, it must also be kept in mind that section 100 of the CPA, 2019 provides that the remedy under CPA is in addition and not in derogation of other available remedies. 3. Mediation: Another remedy available to consumers is mediation. Mediation involves a neutral third party facilitating discussions between the consumer and the technology service provider to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. This approach often provides a quicker and less adversarial way to settle disputes, promoting a win-win situation. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells and resolving consumer complaints using not to take a strictly technical view based solely on the complaint's pleadings. The court rejected the argument that specific averments about the active role of directors, as required in other legal contexts, should apply in this case. Emphasizing the unique language of Section 34(2) of the Act and the gravity of offenses affecting public health, the court upheld the High Court's order. The directors were granted the opportunity to demonstrate to the Trial Court that they were not involved in the manufacturing process and, therefore, should not be held liable under Section 34(2) of the Act. The appeal was dismissed with these observations. Common Cause v. Drug Contr oller of India and Others In the case of Common Cause v. Drug Controller of India and Others (1991), a complaint was made to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission under Section 2(1)(f) of the Consumer Protection Act (defective goods) of the lack of adequate quality control in the manufacturing and bottling and less adversarial way to settle disputes, promoting a win-win situation. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells and resolving consumer complaints using mediation. 4. Central Consumer Protection Authority: If the commission finds violations of rights of consumers or in notice of trade practices which is unfair it can inquire or cause an inquiry, either on receipt of complaint or suo moto or as directed by Central Government. If the commission finds, after preliminary inquiry, of an existence of a prima facie case of consumer rights violation or it is in notice of any unfair trade practice or any wrong or inaccurate advertisement which is prejudicial to public interest or to the interests of the consumers,it can order an investigation by the District Collector or by Director General.

He/she/they can also the   deficiency   in   service   or   defect   in   goods   is   detected.   It's   also   referred   to   as   the   limitation   period.   However ,   the   law   allows   consumers   to   file   complaints   even   after   this   period   if   the   District   Forum   deems   the   reasons   for   the   delay   genuine   and   valid.”   _ Question:   “How   to   make   the   payment   of   the   Court   fee?”   Answer:   “The   court   fee   for   every   complaint   filed   before   the   District   Commission,   State   Commission,   or   National   Commission   must   be   accompanied   by   a   fee   specified.   This   fee   should   be   in   the   form   of   a   crossed   Demand   Draft   drawn   on   a   nationalized   bank   or   through   a   crossed   Indian   Postal   Order   drawn   in   favor   of   the   Registrar   of   the   respective   Commission.

The where   selection,   possession,   maintenance,   and   operation   are   controlled   by   someone   other   than   the   lessor .”   — Question:   “What   are   the   Consumer   Dispute   Redressal   Agencies?” Answer:   “   Consumer   Disputes   Redressal   Agencies,   established   under   the   Consumer   Protection   Act,   are   quasi-judicial   bodies   offering   prompt   and   affordable   resolution   to   consumer   grievances.

Any person or a firm, which pre-packs any decisions at the pre-purchase stage: Provided that a marketplace e-commerce entity shall, on a request in writing made by a consumer after the purchase of any goods or services on its platform by such consumer, provide him with information regarding the seller from which such consumer has made such purchase, including the principal geographic address of its headquarters and all branches, name and details of its website, its email address and any other information necessary for communication with the seller for effective dispute resolution; (b) a ticket number for each complaint lodged through which the consumer can track the status of the complaint;(c) information relating to return, refund, exchange, warranty and guarantee, delivery and shipment, modes of payment, and grievance redressal mechanism, and any other similar information which may be required by consumers to make informed decisions; (d) information on available payment methods, the security of those payment methods, any in the course of the offer on the e-commerce entity's platform or otherwise · falsely represent itself as a consumer and post reviews about goods or services or misrepresent the quality or the features of any goods or services. · refuse to take back goods, or withdraw or discontinue services purchased or agreed to be purchased, or refuse to refund consideration, if paid, if such goods or services are defective, deficient or spurious, or if the goods or services are not of the characteristics or features as advertised or as agreed to, or if such goods or services are delivered late from the stated delivery schedule:(2) Any seller offering goods or services through a marketplace e-commerce entity shall: (a) have a prior written contract with the respective e-commerce entity in order to undertake or solicit such sale or offer; (b) appoint a grievance officer for consumer grievance redressal and ensure that the grievance officer acknowledges the receipt of any consumer complaint within retailer claims that he is offering a special discount on his goods as part of a festival celebration, while he is actually using the festival as an excuse to get rid of old and outdated goods, then he is deceiving consumers. When a toothpaste advertisement says that it prevents cavities, one expects the manufacturer to have the data to prove this. If he fails to do that, then he is making an unsubstantiated claim or a false statement. If an advertisement for a face cream claims that it removes dark spots on the face and even prevents them from coming back, the manufacturer should be able to prove this. Or else, it is a deceptive advertisement. Even reducing crucial information about the product to minute letters at the bottom of the advertisement could be termed as an unfair trade practice, particularly if such information is not intelligible to the consumer. 3. What do I do as a consumer when I see such advertisements? You can register a complaint along with a copy / video / audio

Concu is a popular food chain. I'd like to help you with your consumer grievance.


If you haven't already, I would recommend contacting the customer service team of Concu directly to report the incident and seek a resolution. If they are unresponsive or not helpful, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed with any further steps, have you already tried contacting Concu's customer service team about this incident?

It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.


Before we proceed, would you like me to guide you on how to draft a sample legal notice or would you like to file a complaint with the consumer forum?
