The user was unable to reach Philips customer care after their Philips BT3101/15 product, purchased one week ago, blew a fuse during usage, but they do have the receipt.<|end_end_of_text|>

response    abcdefghijk
I'm sorry to hear that the customer care is unreachable, and the product blew a fuse while in use.


Having the receipt is a good start. Since the product is a Philips item, you can try contacting the Philips customer care through their website or social media channels. If that doesn't work, we can proceed with filing a complaint.


You can also consider visiting the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take.


Before we proceed, I'd like to know what kind of relief are you seeking? Are you looking for a replacement, refund, or something else?
