It seems like a clear case of deficiency in service. As per the Consumer Protection Act 2019, a service provider like a tattoo parlour is responsible for ensuring that the services they provide are safe and do not cause harm to the consumer.


Since you've already contacted the tattoo parlour and they've denied liability, it's time to consider filing a consumer complaint. Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief you're seeking from the tattoo parlour? Are you looking for compensation for the medical expenses, compensation for the pain and discomfort, or something else?

response    abcdefghijk
Covering medical expenses is a reasonable expectation from a service provider like a tattoo parlour. Since the tattoo parlour has denied liability, you may need to take further action to seek compensation.


As a first step, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, stating the details of the incident, the harm caused, and the relief you're seeking. I can provide you with a sample draft if you'd like.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide you with the contact details of the relevant consumer court or authority to file a complaint.


Before we proceed, I have one more question: Do you have any evidence or documentation to support your claim, such as photographs of the tattoo, medical reports, or communication with the tattoo parlour?

Having a photograph of the tattoo and a doctor's prescription is a good starting point for your complaint. Even though the prescription doesn't specify the exact source of the infection, it's still a medical document that supports your claim of harm caused by the tattoo parlour.


Not having a written communication from the parlour on call can make it a bit more challenging, but we can still proceed with drafting a complaint letter and filing a case.


As a next step, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, and also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana.

Chatbot: Covering medical expenses is a reasonable expectation from a service provider like a tattoo parlour. Since the tattoo parlour has denied liability, you may need to take further action to seek compensation.


As a first step, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, stating the details of the incident, the harm caused, and the relief you're seeking. I can provide you with a sample draft if you'd like.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide you with the contact details of the relevant consumer court or authority to file a complaint.


Before we proceed, I have one more question: Do you have any evidence or documentation to support your claim, such as photographs of the tattoo, medical reports, or communication with the tattoo parlour?
User: I have photograph which I took later and the doctor's prescription for infection but the prescription does not say where I got the infection from. No I don't have the communication from the parlour as it was on call.
Chatbot: Having a photograph of the tattoo and a doctor's prescription is a good starting point for your complaint. Even though the prescription doesn't specify the exact source of the infection, it's still a medical document that supports your claim of harm caused by the tattoo parlour.


Not having a written communication from the parlour on call can make it a bit more challenging, but we can still proceed with drafting a complaint letter and filing a case.


As a next step, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, and also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana.


Before we proceed, I want to inform you that you can also file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal, which is a government initiative to facilitate online filing of consumer complaints. Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint online?

response    abcdefghijk
Yes, in addition to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000), you can also reach out to the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana. The SDRC is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the state level.


To find the contact details of the SDRC in Telangana, you can visit the National Consumer Helpline website (nch.nic.in) and search for the contact information of the SDRC in Telangana. You can also try searching online for "Telangana State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission" or "Telangana Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum".


Alternatively, you can also contact the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in the district where the tattoo parlour is located. The DCDRF is the first level of consumer dispute redressal at the district level.


Additionally, you can also contact the Consumer Affairs Department of the Government of Telangana, which is responsible for handling consumer complaints and grievances in the state. You can find their contact details on the official website of the Government of Telangana.


It's worth noting that you can also contact the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), which is a national-level body responsible for protecting consumer rights. However, as this is a state-level issue, it's best to start with the state-level authorities first.


Would you like me to provide you with the contact details of the CCPA or the Consumer Affairs Department of Telangana?

﻿Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User: Hi I got a tattoo and now I have developed an infection due to it. The tattoo parlour is saying they are not liable and I might have had some allergy which I did not disclose. Is it possible to file a consumer grievance over this?
Chatbot: I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Yes, it is possible to file a consumer grievance in this case. As a consumer, you have the right to seek redressal for any harm or injury caused by a service provider, including a tattoo parlour.


To move forward, can you please provide more details about what happened? For instance, what type of tattoo did you get, and when did you get it done? Also, have you contacted the tattoo parlour to report the issue and seek a resolution?
User: I got this done in XYZ tattoos in Hyderabad in a mall. I got a scorpion done and this was a week ago. I have contacted them but they said they are not liable for this.
Chatbot: It seems like a clear case of deficiency in service. As per the Consumer Protection Act 2019, a service provider like a tattoo parlour is responsible for ensuring that the services they provide are safe and do not cause harm to the consumer.


Since you've already contacted the tattoo parlour and they've denied liability, it's time to consider filing a consumer complaint. Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief you're seeking from the tattoo parlour? Are you looking for compensation for the medical expenses, compensation for the pain and discomfort, or something else?
User: I need them to cover my medical expenses
Chatbot: Covering medical expenses is a reasonable expectation from a service provider like a tattoo parlour. Since the tattoo parlour has denied liability, you may need to take further action to seek compensation.


As a first step, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, stating the details of the incident, the harm caused, and the relief you're seeking. I can provide you with a sample draft if you'd like.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide you with the contact details of the relevant consumer court or authority to file a complaint.


Before we proceed, I have one more question: Do you have any evidence or documentation to support your claim, such as photographs of the tattoo, medical reports, or communication with the tattoo parlour?
User: I have photograph which I took later and the doctor's prescription for infection but the prescription does not say where I got the infection from. No I don't have the communication from the parlour as it was on call.
Chatbot: Having a photograph of the tattoo and a doctor's prescription is a good starting point for your complaint. Even though the prescription doesn't specify the exact source of the infection, it's still a medical document that supports your claim of harm caused by the tattoo parlour.


Not having a written communication from the parlour on call can make it a bit more challenging, but we can still proceed with drafting a complaint letter and filing a case.


As a next step, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, and also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana.

Additionally, you can also contact the Consumer Affairs Department of the Government of Telangana, which is responsible for handling consumer complaints and grievances in the state. You can find their contact details on the official website of the Government of Telangana.
