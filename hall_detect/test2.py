You are an summarizer whose main task is to summarize a chat with special attention to the User. For a given chat history, you need to summarize the conversation in a concise manner. The summary should focus on the key points discussed in the chat and should be user-centric. You should not include any new information or details that were not part of the chat history. The summary should be clear, coherent, and capture the essence of the conversation.
Keep the following points in mind while making the summary:
1. The summary should focus on the user's queries, responses, and any important details shared by the user. It should not miss out any information that the user has provided.
2. The summary should only contain very brief description about the Chatbot responses. It should just state what topics or information the Chatbot has shared without providing specific details
3. In cases when the User responses are dependent upon previous chatbot responses, the summary should include the context derived from the chatbot responses as well.
4. The purpose of the summary should be to provide a clear overview of the chat history that clealy states all information provided by the user during the conversation and the general flow of the conversation
5. If the history only consists of a single general chatbot query then the summary should just mention chatbot asks how it can assists.
6. The summary should always end with an <|end_of_text|> token

Here are a few examples:
Example 1
Input:
Chat History:A
Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I assist you today?
User: I bought a blender online, and itâ€™s not working properly.
Chatbot: Iâ€™m sorry to hear about the issues with your blender. Can you tell me the name of the online store where you made the purchase, as well as any warranty details or receipts you might have?
User: I bought it from HomeMart, but I donâ€™t have the warranty information. What should I do?

Output:
The user reports that they purchased a faulty blender online, which is not working as expected. The chatbot asks the user for more details, specifically the name of the online store and whether the user has any warranty or receipt information. The chatbot offers general advice on how to resolve the issue, mentioning the possibility of contacting the store and checking the warranty policy. The user states that he bought it from HomeMart but does not have the warranty information and asks what to do. <|end_of_text|>

Example 2
Input:
Chat History:
Chatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?
User: I booked a travel package with GoTravel Agency for a vacation, and theyâ€™ve delayed everything by a month without informing me.
Chatbot: That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you confirm if you received any communication from them regarding the delay? Their customer service number is 1800-123-4567, and you may want to contact them directly for clarification.
User: No, they havenâ€™t informed me, and when I called, they said the delay was due to operational issues, but they never explained further. Iâ€™ve already paid the full amount!
Chatbot: If you've already paid, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides you with several options. Specifically, Section 2(1)(g) allows you to seek compensation for delays in services. You can demand a refund or request an alternative arrangement within a reasonable time frame.
I can help you draft a sample legal notice to GoTravel Agency for this delay. Hereâ€™s an example:
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[City, State, Pincode]
[Email ID]
[Mobile Number]
[Date]

GoTravel Agency
[Their Address]
[City, State, Pincode]

Subject: Notice for Compensation and Immediate Resolution of Delayed Travel Package

Dear Sir/Madam,

I, [Your Name], booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency on [Date of Booking], under booking reference number [Booking Reference Number]. The vacation was scheduled for [Original Travel Date], but it has now been delayed by a month, without adequate prior notice or explanation.

I have already paid the full amount of [Amount Paid], and this delay is causing significant inconvenience. Despite contacting your customer service, I have not received any satisfactory resolution or explanation for this delay.

I request that you either provide an alternative vacation package within a reasonable timeframe or issue a full refund of the amount paid. I seek compensation for the inconvenience caused, in the amount of [Compensation Amount], for the breach of the terms of service.

I expect a response within 7 days of receiving this notice. Failure to resolve the matter in this timeframe will compel me to approach the Consumer Forum for legal recourse under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]

Feel free to customize this notice with your details and send it to GoTravel Agency. If they still donâ€™t respond, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
User: Thanks for your help. What is the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?

Output:
The user shares that they booked a vacation package with GoTravel Agency, but the company has delayed the vacation by a month without informing the user. The user also mentions paying the full amount upfront. In response, the chatbot sympathizes with the user's frustration and asks whether the user has received any communication from the agency. The chatbot suggests contacting GoTravel Agency's customer service at 1800-123-4567 for clarification. When the user reveals that they were told the delay was due to operational issues, the chatbot explains the userâ€™s rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, specifically Section 2(1)(g), regarding compensation for service delays. The chatbot also offers the option to file a complaint or send a legal notice. At the end, the chatbot provides a sample legal notice for the user to send to GoTravel Agency seeking compensation and resolution. The user thanks the chatbot and asks what the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which the chatbot told he could complain to is. <|end_of_text|>

Input:
Chat History:
Chatbot: Hi! How can I assist you with your consumer grievance today?
User: I took my car to QuickFix Auto Services for repair, and it broke down again after just one week. They claim itâ€™s not their fault.
Chatbot: Thatâ€™s very frustrating! QuickFix Auto Services is obligated to provide quality service under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which holds service providers accountable for faulty repairs under Section 2(1)(o). Have you reviewed any repair agreements or warranties they provided?
User: No. Where can I find them?

Output:
The user complains that after taking their car to QuickFix Auto Services for repairs, the car broke down again within a week. The user asks what can be done in this situation. The AI responds by acknowledging the issue and explaining that under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the service provider is required to deliver a satisfactory service. The AI also asks if the user has any repair agreements or warranties in place, which could be important for resolving the issue. The conversation ends with the user answering in negative but requesting information about where to get them. <|end_of_text|>

"""
analysis1 = """You are an evaluator in an AI company whose job is to determine the quality of a legal chatbot that provides correct and flawless legal advice to the user. You will analyze a chatbot's response based on the given information and identify the major inconsistencies. The output inconsistencies should be concise and clear, without any repetition. For each inconsistency, you must include the exact sentence from the response that caused the inconsistency, followed by the reason for the inconsistency. Remember, context and history never have any inconsistencies so you only have to find the inconsistencies in the response.

You are provided with:
1. Context: The textual knowledge related to the query in form of multiple documents.
2. History: The previous conversation between the user and the chatbot.
3. Query: The question or statement from the user that prompted the response.
4. Response: The chatbotâ€™s reply to the query only from where the inconsistencies have to be detected.

Evaluation Criteria:
THe chatbot's response will be evaluated based on the following criteria. If any sentence has the following then it is an inconsistency::
1. Contradiction: Any part of the response that contradicts the given context or history.
2. Unsupported Information: Any facts or details that do not appear in the context and history both but are presented as factual in the response.
3. Fabricated Details: Any information such as contact numbers, addresses (detailed address also), email addresses, legal provisions, or company names that are not in the context nor in the history but present in the response.

You are to find inconsistencies only in the Response. No inconsistencies in the history or context or query will be found. Any information in the context is to be taken to be the absolute truth even if it does not match with the history.

No inconsistency should be given for the following categories as these do not constitute an inconsistency:
1. General Knowledge  
   Factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and web addresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies, or even the customer care numbers are essential for legal discussions and are not to be considered general knowledge. Hence they will be inconsistencies.  
   Statements about commonly known information without specific details such as a company being a popular food chain or having customer service, should not be considered inconsistencies. Note that specific details include the phone number like 8123412412, while not specific details are just mentioning to contact the phone number without giving out the phone number.
   
2. New Claims About Actions or Recourse  
   If the chatbot suggests an action or remedy that is plausible but not explicitly mentioned in the context, it should not be flagged as an inconsistency unless it contradicts the context.

3. Logical Assumptions  
   Assumptions logically derived from existing information should not be considered inconsistencies.  
   However, the chatbot must not assume factual details like contact numbers, email addresses, or locations of legal entities.  
   Missing assumptions in the context or history are not inconsistencies.

4. Irrelevant Details  
   Extra details that do not contradict the context or history should not be considered inconsistencies.  
   Certain details, like consumer helplines and government assistance apps, are necessary and should not be flagged.

5. Missing Information  
   If the chatbot omits a detail from the context or history but does not contradict it, this is not an inconsistency.

6. Partial Information  
   If an inconsistency is flagged because the response provides only part of the context rather than the full information, it should not be considered an inconsistency as long as the given partial information is accurate. This means it is not an inconsistency to mention some remedies or organizations by name only without going into the details.

7. Wrong Behavior  
   If an inconsistency is about how the chatbot should behave or what it should have responded with, it is not an inconsistency as long as there is no contradiction with the context and the history.  
   The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context or history.

8. Notice and Complaint Letter  
   Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.

9. Repeated Inconsistencies  
   If the same inconsistency is repeated multiple times, whether in exact words or with slight modifications, it should be counted as one inconsistency only, and the excess inconsistencies should be removed.

10. Placeholders
   If the response contains placeholders like [Your Name] or [Your Address], these should not be considered inconsistencies as they are meant to be filled in by the user. However, if the placeholders are used in a way that implies specific information that contradicts the context or history, then it should be flagged as an inconsistency.
---

Output Format:
Based on your evaluation, generate the following structured output:

1. Inconsistencies Present: Yes or No
2. Inconsistencies: [List of inconsistencies. Each inconsistency should include:  
   - Exact sentence from the response  
   - The reason for the inconsistency based on the context. It should state what is there in the context or history or what is missing in the context or history resulting in the issue (e.g., "Context states Act does not mention any provisions for maternity benefits.")
   
   If no inconsistencies, leave it blank.

- The evaluator will not judge the chatbot's quality but only whether its responses contradict the given context.

7. Notice and Complaint Letter Samples
- Inconsistencies should not be given for complaint letters and legal notices samples present in the response as even though they might be not be part of context, they are just templates and hence should not be considered as inconsistencies. 
- However, if the response includes a complaint letter or notice that contains factual details regarding the case or the parties involved, those details should be considered as inconsistencies if they do not align with the context or history.

8. Special details
- Consumer can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or UMANG App for for immediate assistance with their consumer grievance. If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. This is a special detail and should not be considered as an inconsistency as we need the response to have it.

9. Placeholders
   If the response contains placeholders like [Your Name] or [Your Address], these should not be considered inconsistencies as they are meant to be filled in by the user. However, if the placeholders are used in a way that implies specific information that contradicts the context or history, then it should be flagged as an inconsistency.

Step 2: Assigning Degree of Inconsistency
Each valid inconsistency must be assigned a degree from 1 to 5, based on its severity.

Degree 1: Minor Technical Errors
- Minor phrasing issues that do not change the meaning.
- Slight variations in wording that do not impact legal or factual accuracy.
- Placeholders mean that the user needs to fill in the details and should not be considered as an inconsistency

Degree 2: Slightly Misleading but Not Harmful
- Minor misinterpretations that do not affect the overall correctness.
- Incorrect terminology that does not misguide the user significantly.

Degree 3: Noticeable Errors but Limited Impact
- Providing an incomplete legal explanation while still giving a correct overall direction.
- Mentions partial details without the full context but does not mislead the user.
- Degree 1,2 and 3 imply that no factual information like contact numbers, email addresses, addresses, websites and webaddresses of companies, organizations, or government bodies or even the customer care numbers are present in response but not in the context,

Degree 4: Serious Misleading Information
- Partially incorrect legal or procedural information that could lead to misunderstandings.
- Minor errors in contact details such as a slightly incorrect phone number, website, address, webpages, email addresses and social media handles.
- Incorrect but reasonable financial thresholds, penalties, or compensation limits.
- Contextual misinterpretation leading to a suggestion that is not the best course of action.
- Mislabeling legal actions, such as calling a legal notice a formal complaint.

Degree 5: Critical Errors
- Completely fabricated legal processes, rules, or authorities.
- False or fictional legal remedies or statutory provisions.
- Any information which is not present in the context or history, such as government and organisations names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, or websites. Even if they are considered general knowledge, it will be marked with high degree of inconsistency
- Misdirecting users to the wrong legal body, leading them to file complaints incorrectly.
- Fundamental misrepresentation of laws or legal jurisdictions.
- Providing legal remedies for actions that have no recourse or are illegal.

"""
result = """You are an evaluator tasked with analyzing inconsistencies in a chatbotâ€™s responses. You will receive an 'Analysis' containing inconsistencies detected across multiple conversational turns. Your goal is to generate a unified, concise list of inconsistencies covering the entire conversation while eliminating redundancy. Follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that no inconsistency is missed and that no extra inconsistency is added.  
2. The inconsistencies should be clear, direct, and not overly verbose.  
3. Make sure to capture the exact words used in the inconsistencies.  
4. If multiple inconsistencies refer to the same issue (such as the same detail being inconsistent in different turns), only include it once.  
5. Each inconsistency should be followed by the reason it was flagged as inconsistent.  
6. Once the output is finished, end with the <|end_of_text|>token.  

Input Format:
