AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better assist you, could you please provide more information about what led to this issue? Was the tracking ID provided by the courier service, and have you contacted their customer care already?


Human: no tracking ID yet, it just says dispatched. customer care is not responsive


AI: Not having a tracking ID makes it more challenging. Since customer care is not responsive, it's essential to escalate the issue. Have you placed the order more than two years ago? If yes, please note that the statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India is two years.


Human: no, i placed it on 15-08-2024


AI: Since the order was placed recently, you have time to address the issue. Considering the parcel has been stuck for over a month, I would recommend contacting the courier service's customer care again, or you can try reaching out to their local office for assistance. If you're not satisfied with their response, you can also consider filing a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the e-daakhil portal.

3. The details of the issue (i.e., parcel stuck at 'in transit' for over a month and no updates).

Once I have this information, I can help you draft a notice.


Human: but its a cash on delivery order


AI: In that case, the relief you're seeking might be to cancel the order or to refund the amount. Please confirm if that's correct.


Also, since it's a cash on delivery order, the courier service might not have received the payment yet. We'll need to consider that in the notice.

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I purchased a cosmetic serum claiming to have 'anti-aging' properties, but after three months of use, I see no results.


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. 


To better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led you to purchase this serum? Was it the advertisement, recommendation from a friend, or something else?


Human: advertisement 


AI: Advertisements can be misleading at times. 


To further assist you, can you please tell me when you purchased the serum? This will help me understand if it's within the statute of limitations for filing a complaint. (As per Indian consumer law, the statute of limitations is 2 years from the date of purchase.) Today's date is 01-10-2024.


Human: last month


AI: Since you purchased the serum last month, you have sufficient time to take action.


Can you please tell me more about the advertisement that caught your attention? Was it a TV commercial, social media ad, or print ad? What specifically made you think the serum would have anti-aging properties?


Human: social media ad 


AI: Social media ads can be particularly persuasive.


Now, I'd like to know if you've already tried contacting the company or the seller regarding your concerns about the serum not living up to its claims. Have you sent them a message, email, or any other form of communication?


Human: yep, they asked me to wait for some time. but the ad said results in two weeks 


AI: It sounds like the company is stalling, and the ad's promise of results within two weeks is a major issue here.


Given the discrepancy between the ad's claim and the actual outcome, it seems like a strong case for a complaint. 


As a consumer, you have the right to expect that advertisements are truthful and not misleading. Have you thought about what kind of relief you would like to seek from the company, such as a refund, replacement, or a formal apology?


Human: what relief would be appropriate


AI: Considering the company's failure to deliver on their promise, a suitable relief could be:


1. **Refund**: You could seek a full or partial refund of the purchase price.
2. **Replacement**: If the company has a similar product that actually delivers on its claims, you might ask for a replacement.
3. **Discount or Store Credit**: A discount on your next purchase or a store credit could be another option.
4. **Formal Apology**: A public apology or a private acknowledgment of their mistake could be a good way to hold them accountable.
5. **Compensation for Time and Effort**: If you've wasted your time and effort due to the company's false claims, you might ask for compensation.


Which of these options resonates with you, or do you think of something else?


Human: what else can i do


AI: In addition to seeking relief from the company, you can also:


1. **File a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline**: You can call 1800-11-4000 or register your complaint online at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/.
2. **Register your complaint with the Central Consumer Protection Authority**: They can help you with mediation and enforcement of consumer rights.

4. **Contact the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)**: They regulate and monitor advertisements in India, and you can report the company's misleading ad to them.
5. **Consider taking legal action**: If the company continues to ignore your complaints, you may want to consult with a consumer rights lawyer to explore your options.


Which of these options do you think you might pursue?


Also, do you need help drafting a notice or complaint to send to the company?


Human: yes notice 


AI: Before we proceed with drafting a notice, I'll need some more information. Please provide the following details:


1. **Your name and address**: So that the notice includes your contact information.

**Complaint to the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum**


To,


The Honorable President,
District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum,
[District Name]


Subject: Complaint against Maximalist for Misrepresentation and Unfair Trade Practices


Before the Honourable Forum,


I, Jane Doe, a consumer residing at 123 Doddanakundi, Bengaluru, humbly submit this complaint against Maximalist, a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling cosmetic products, including the Vitamin C Serum.


**Parties involved:**

**Grievance:**


The opposite party, Maximalist, has made false and misleading claims in their advertisements regarding the Vitamin C Serum, which I purchased from them on [date]. The advertisement claimed that the product ""assures anti-aging in 2 weeks"". However, after using the product for [duration], I have not seen any noticeable improvement in my skin, let alone the promised results.

Human: why district forum


AI: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (District Forum) is a quasi-judicial body that handles consumer disputes where the value of the goods or services does not exceed one crore rupees. In your case, since you've purchased the Vitamin C Serum for a relatively small amount, the District Forum is the appropriate forum to file your complaint.


Here's why:


1. **Pecuniary jurisdiction**: The District Forum has jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services does not exceed one crore rupees. Since you've purchased the Vitamin C Serum for a smaller amount, the District Forum is the correct forum.
2. **Territorial jurisdiction**: The District Forum has jurisdiction over the district where you reside. In your case, since you reside in Bengaluru, the District Forum of Bengaluru would be the correct forum.


If the value of the goods or services exceeds one crore rupees, you would need to file your complaint with the State Commission or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC).


Here's a brief summary of the jurisdictional limits for each forum:


* District Forum: Up to one crore rupees
* State Commission: Above one crore rupees but not exceeding ten crore rupees
* NCDRC: Above ten crore rupees


Human: thanks! 


AI: It was my pleasure to assist you with your consumer grievance. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.


Remember to file your complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the Central Consumer Protection Authority for further assistance.


Also, don't forget to keep a copy of the notice and complaint for your records.


Best of luck with your case, and I hope you get the relief you deserve!

Human: A TV network canceled my favorite show mid-season despite selling an entire season pass. Can I request a partial refund?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to this situation? Was there any specific reason or notice given by the TV network for canceling the show?


Human: they said that it was due to a non availability of actors 


AI: It seems like the TV network cited a valid reason for canceling the show. However, since you had purchased a season pass, you might be eligible for a partial refund or some form of compensation. 


Can you please tell me when you purchased the season pass and when you became aware of the show's cancellation? This will help me determine if you're within the statute of limitations (2 years in India) to file a complaint.


Human: purchased on 1/08/2024, cancelled on 10/09/2024 


AI: You purchased the season pass on August 1, 2024, and the show was canceled on September 10, 2024. Since the show was canceled just a month after you purchased the season pass, it's likely that you're still within the statute of limitations to file a complaint.


Considering this timeline, you can try to request a partial refund from the TV network. You can draft a complaint letter or email to them, stating the issue and the desired relief.


Would you like me to provide a sample draft for a notice you can send to the TV network?

3,"addresses for karnataka dispute commission + the district commission were hallucinated. the contact numbers were also incorrect. - provided me with provisions from CPA 1986 instead of CPA 2019, when I asked it for the relevant provisions this  issue would fall under. ",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDac4xM2shjiAOkWubjCpRDDoVXf1pZEcQzAb8yAGfQ/edit?usp=sharing,"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I went out to a restaurant with my friends and they charged us for cleaning up a mess one of them made, called a 'vomit fee', which they did not mention before. Is this allowed? 


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer-related issues. 


You mentioned a restaurant charged you a 'vomit fee' which was not mentioned beforehand. I would like to ask, did you sign any contract or agreement before dining at the restaurant, or was it just a casual meal?


Human: just a casual meal


AI: It was a casual meal. 


You were not informed about the 'vomit fee' beforehand, which is a hidden charge. In consumer law, service providers are expected to clearly disclose any additional charges or fees at the time of services.


Can you please tell me approximately when this incident occurred?


Human: last night


AI: It happened last night.


As per the Consumer Protection Act in India, you have the right to take action against the restaurant if they have failed to disclose the 'vomit fee' beforehand. You can file a complaint to the restaurant in writing, stating your grievances and asking for a refund of the 'vomit fee'.


If the restaurant doesn't respond or doesn't take any action, you can consider filing a complaint to the Consumer Commission. Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a complaint letter or a notice to the restaurant?


Human: which provisions would apply to this?


AI: Based on your case, the following provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 might be applicable:


1. Section 2(1)(b) which defines a service provider as any person who claims to be provider of services.
2. Section 2(1)(c) which defines a consumer as a person who is availing of services.
3. Section 2(1)(r) which defines unfair trade practices, which might include not disclosing additional fees or charges beforehand.
4. Section 6(1)(a) which gives the consumer the right to get goods or services from a service provider for a consideration.


Moreover, the provision of the State's District Consumer Dispute Redressal Act would be applicable, as you can file a complaint at the District Level.


However, the key ingredient is non-disclosure of the 'vomit fee', which can be argued as an unfair trade practice under the Act.


You may also consider filing a complaint under the State's District Consumer Dispute Redressal Act, where you can seek relief for your grievances.


Human: what can i do now 


AI: Based on our conversation, it seems like you have a valid case against the restaurant for not disclosing the 'vomit fee' beforehand.


Here are the next steps you can take:


1. **Write to the restaurant**: Draft a complaint letter to the restaurant, stating your grievances and asking for a refund of the 'vomit fee'. You can use the draft I provided earlier as a starting point.
2. **Send the complaint letter**: Send the complaint letter to the restaurant by registered post, along with a copy to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for their records.
3. **Wait for a response**: Wait for the restaurant to respond to your complaint. If they don't respond or don't take any action, you can proceed to the next step.
4. **File a complaint with the Consumer Commission**: If the restaurant doesn't respond or doesn't take any action, you can file a complaint with the Consumer Commission at the district level.


Additionally, I can help you draft a complaint letter or a notice to the restaurant. Would you like me to do that?


Also, please note that you can also file a complaint online at the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/. You can log in and follow the instructions to file a complaint.


Lastly, I would like to remind you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) can provide you with immediate assistance and guidance. They can also help you file a complaint online or provide you with the contact details of the nearest Consumer Commission.

",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9_Hy9rrTpFsMc5BUQWZsd9wW6Wc7--MJDvOBVQzDfU/edit,"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: Hello, I went to a premium hospital for eye surgery where they said that Dr. Ramesh would do the surgery, since I am paying a high amount I assumed I would be provided with top-notch services. However, after surgery I came to know that Dr. Ramesh was a homeopathy doctor not a allopathic doctor. Can I file a complaint against the hospital for this?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. That's a serious issue, and you have every right to be upset. 


Before we proceed, can you please tell me when this incident occurred? We need to consider the statute of limitations, which is 2 years in India. If the incident happened more than 2 years ago, we may need to explore alternative options.


Also, can you please confirm if Dr. Ramesh was indeed the operating surgeon, and if the hospital had explicitly stated that he was a homeopathy doctor or if this was not mentioned at all?


Human: The incident happened on 6th December 2022 and Dr. Ramesh was the one who operated on me. The hospital never mentioned that he was a homeopathy doctor.


AI: Given that the incident occurred on 6th December 2022, it's within the 2-year statute of limitations.


This is a clear case of breach of duty by the hospital, as they did not provide you with the medical services that you paid for. In this case, treating a patient with allopathic treatment by a homeopathic doctor can be considered as a deviation from the standard of care.


You have the right to file a complaint against the hospital for this. We can proceed with drafting a legal notice, which is the first step in seeking relief under the Consumer Protection Act.


Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from the hospital? Do you want a refund of your money, compensation for any injury or suffering caused, or something else?


Human: I am seeking refund for the operation and compensation as I am a very health conscious person and getting operation done from someone who was not qualified to do it put me in immense mental stress


AI: I understand your concerns and the emotional distress you've experienced. Seeking a refund and compensation is a reasonable expectation, given the circumstances.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, you can claim a refund and compensation for the mental agony caused, which is a recognized heads of damages under the Act.


We can draft a legal notice to the hospital, stating the breach of duty, the harm caused, and the relief sought. Before we proceed, I'd like to inform you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App can provide immediate assistance in resolving your complaint.


However, if you'd like to proceed with drafting a legal notice, I can assist you in preparing the necessary documents.


Additionally, as the Supreme Court has recognized medical negligence as a service under the Consumer Protection Act, you can also approach the State Medical Council (SMC) or the Medical Council of India (MCI) for further action.


Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other concerns you'd like to address before we proceed?


Human: Which consumer helpline number can I contact?


AI: You can contact the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000, which is available all days except national holidays, from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. You can also reach them through SMS at 8800001915, or register your grievance online at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/user/signup.php.


Alternatively, you can also use the UMANG App, which is the National Consumer Helpline's application. You can download it from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store and register your grievance through the app.


Additionally, if you're looking for a state-specific helpline number, I can provide you with the contact numbers for various states. Please let me know if you'd like me to share those with you.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: If the operation happened in Andhra Pradesh, what would be the helpline number?


AI: If the operation happened in Andhra Pradesh, you can contact the State Consumer Helpline of Andhra Pradesh at 1800-425-4444 or 1800-425-4445. These numbers are available 24/7 to assist with consumer grievances.

Please note that the helpline numbers may be subject to change, so it's always a good idea to verify the numbers before contacting them.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: I would like to take legal action against the hospital, what are the remedies avaliable? 


AI: If you decide to take legal action against the hospital, here are some remedies available to you:


1. **Filing a Complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF)**: As the hospital is based in Andhra Pradesh, you can file a complaint with the DCDRF in the district where the hospital is located. The DCDRF has the power to settle consumer disputes with a maximum value of Rs. 1 crore.
2. **Filing a Complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC)**: If the value of your dispute exceeds Rs. 1 crore, you can file a complaint with the SCDRC in Andhra Pradesh. The SCDRC has the power to settle consumer disputes with a maximum value of Rs. 10 crores.
3. **Filing a Complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)**: If the value of your dispute exceeds Rs. 10 crores, you can file a complaint with the NCDRC in New Delhi. The NCDRC has the power to settle consumer disputes with a maximum value of Rs. 1 crore.

Before taking legal action, I would recommend drafting a legal notice to the hospital, which I can assist you with. The legal notice will serve as a formal complaint and will give the hospital an opportunity to respond and resolve the matter amicably.


Would you like me to help you draft a legal notice to the hospital?


Human: Please draft a legal notice for me

The hospital's breach of duty and negligence has caused me immense mental stress, anxiety, and financial loss. I am entitled to compensation for the harm caused to me, including a refund of the amount paid for the surgery and compensation for the mental agony suffered.


I hereby demand that you take the following steps:

2. Provide compensation for the mental agony and suffering caused.
3. Take immediate action to rectify the situation and prevent such negligence in the future.


If I do not receive a satisfactory response from you within 30 days of receipt of this notice, I shall be forced to initiate legal proceedings against you, including filing a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) and seeking compensation accordingly.


**Supporting Documents:**

[Your Name]


**Please note:** Before sending this notice, please ensure that you have all the necessary documents and information ready. Also, please note that this is a draft notice, and you should consult with a lawyer before sending it to the hospital.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: If the hospital doesn't replies to my notice, what can I do?


AI: If the hospital doesn't reply to your notice, you can consider the following options:


1. **File a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF)**: As the hospital is based in Andhra Pradesh, you can file a complaint with the DCDRF in the district where the hospital is located. The DCDRF has the power to settle consumer disputes with a maximum value of Rs. 1 crore.
2. **File a complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC)**: If the value of your dispute exceeds Rs. 1 crore, you can file a complaint with the SCDRC in Andhra Pradesh. The SCDRC has the power to settle consumer disputes with a maximum value of Rs. 10 crores.
3. **File a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)**: If the value of your dispute exceeds Rs. 10 crores, you can file a complaint with the NCDRC in New Delhi. The NCDRC has the power to settle consumer disputes with a maximum value of Rs. 1 crore.
4. **File a civil suit in a court of law**: As a last resort, you can file a civil suit in a court of law against the hospital. However, this option may be more expensive and time-consuming.

Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: I want to file a complaint, the value of the operation was 50,000 but I want to claim 2crore as compensation, can I file such a complaint?


AI: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) can entertain matters where the value of goods or services paid as consideration exceeds Rs. 10 crores.


However, since the value of the operation is Rs. 50,000, which is much lower than Rs. 10 crores, you cannot file a complaint directly with the NCDRC.


Instead, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC), as they have the jurisdiction to deal with cases below Rs. 10 crores.


Regarding your claim for Rs. 2 crore as compensation, you can still file a complaint with the DCDRF or SCDRC, but you will need to demonstrate the basis of your claim. The Commission will then assess the merits of your claim and award compensation based on the principles of Indian law.


Please note that the amount of compensation awarded by the Commission will depend on various factors, including the extent of the harm caused, the negligence of the hospital, and the laws applicable in your state.


Before filing a complaint, I would recommend consulting with a lawyer to discuss the merits of your case and the best course of action.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: I want to file a complaint for 100000. Where 50,000 is for refund and 50,000 for compensation. 


AI: Filing a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) would be the next step.


As the value of the complaint is below Rs. 1 crore, you can file a complaint with the DCDRF. However, since you are claiming compensation in addition to a refund, you will need to specify the amount of compensation you are seeking and provide justification for the same.


The DCDRF will then assess the merits of your claim and award compensation based on the principles of Indian law.


Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow:


1. **Obtain a copy of the DCDRF's complaint form**: You can download the form from the official website of the DCDRF or obtain it from the Forum's office in person.
2. **Fill out the complaint form**: Provide all the necessary details, including your name, address, contact information, and a detailed description of the complaint.
3. **Attach supporting documents**: Include any supporting documents, such as receipts, medical records, and witness statements, that can help substantiate your claim.
4. **Submit the complaint form**: File the completed complaint form with the DCDRF, along with the required fee, which is typically Rs. 100.


Please note that the DCDRF may require you to appear before them for a hearing, where you will have the opportunity to present your case and respond to any questions or objections raised by the hospital.

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: Hi, I bought tickets to watch a movie at PVR Cinemas at Orion Mall on 13th April 2022. However, after reaching the movie hall, I was informed that the movie will not be playing. I asked for a refund of the tickets which I have still not received. What should I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me.
To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to the decision of the movie not being played at PVR Cinemas on that day? Was there any communication or notice from the cinema regarding the cancellation of the movie?


Human: I was told after reaching the hall, 5 minutes before the show played that there was not enough audience to warrant playing the movie.
That's unfortunate. It seems like there was a last-minute decision to cancel the show due to lack of audience.


AI: Can you please tell me the date today so I can remind you about the statute of limitations for filing a complaint, which is 2 years from the date of the incident? What is today's date, please?


Human: today's date is 1st October 2024


AI: Since the incident occurred on 13th April 2022, which is more than 2 years ago, you might be running out of time to file a complaint. However, it's always a good idea to consult with a lawyer or a consumer rights expert to determine the best course of action.


Now, let's focus on the current situation. You have not received a refund for the movie ticket. Did you ask PVR Cinemas for a refund after the cancellation, and if so, what was their response?


Human: Yes, I called their customer care wherein they said that they would refund the money within a week. However, I did not receive it. After this I repeatedly emailed them asking for the refund.
It seems like PVR Cinemas initially promised to refund the money within a week but failed to do so, despite your repeated follow-up emails.


AI: Can you please tell me what kind of refund you are expecting from PVR Cinemas? Are you looking for a full refund of the ticket price, or something else?


Human: I would like full refund of the ticket and additional compensation for transport having not informed me in advance


AI: You are seeking a full refund of the ticket price, as well as compensation for the transportation costs that you incurred, since you were not informed in advance about the cancellation of the movie.


Considering that the airline (in this case, PVR Cinemas) has not fulfilled its obligation to inform you in advance about the cancellation, and has also not refunded the ticket price as promised, it seems like you have a valid case for seeking compensation.


I can help you draft a legal notice to PVR Cinemas, outlining the issues and seeking a refund and compensation. Alternatively, if you would like, we can explore other options, such as filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or using the UMANG App for assistance.


Before we proceed, is there anything else you would like to add or discuss regarding your issue with PVR Cinemas?


Human: PVR is not an airline


AI: You are correct, PVR Cinemas is not an airline. I should have been more precise in my terminology.


In that case, let's focus on the consumer protection laws applicable to PVR Cinemas. As a cinema chain, PVR Cinemas has certain obligations towards its customers, including providing refunds for cancelled shows and informing customers in advance about cancellations.


Considering your situation, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint to PVR Cinemas, outlining the issues and seeking a refund and compensation. If they fail to respond or resolve the issue, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or using the UMANG App for assistance.

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: Hey! I want to file a complaint against my lawyer.


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To help you better, can you please tell me what led to the issue with your lawyer? Was it a dispute over fees, a disagreement on case strategy, or something else?


Human: I had engaged my lawyer for a family dispute. However, he failed to inform me that a hearing was coming up and that resulted in an ex parte order against me


AI: It sounds like a serious issue. Can you please tell me when this incident occurred? Was it recently or a while back? (Please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, the limitation period for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date the cause of action arises.)


Human: which incident specifically?


AI: I meant the incident of your lawyer failing to inform you about the hearing and the resulting ex parte order. Could you please tell me when you came to know about this incident? Was it recently or did you find out later?


Human: The hearing was on 20th April 2024. I got to know on 30th April.


AI: Since you found out about the incident on 30th April 2024, the hearing took place on 20th April 2024. This means that the limitation period for filing a complaint would have started from 20th April 2024. As of today's date (01 October 2024), you still have time to file a complaint.


Can you please tell me more about your lawyer? Do you have their contact information or any details about their practice?


Human: His name is Adv Harish Singh. He practices in the Dwarka Court in Delhi. 


AI: Thank you for providing that information. It seems that Adv. Harish Singh is a practicing lawyer in the Dwarka Court of Delhi.


Since you're considering filing a complaint against him, I'll offer to provide you with some guidance on drafting a legal notice. However, before we proceed, I want to clarify: are you looking to resolve this issue amicably, or are you considering taking further legal action against Adv. Harish Singh?


Also, I would like to inform you that you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or through their online portal at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/. They can provide you with further assistance and guidance on the process.


Human: Before anything, I wanted to confirm if consumer court will be an appropriate forum for a complaint of such nature?


AI: The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (CPA) does provide a framework for redressal of consumer grievances, but it's specific to consumer-related issues.


In your case, the issue is with your lawyer's services, which falls under the bar council's jurisdiction rather than the consumer court's. The Bar Council of India has its own mechanism for dealing with complaints against lawyers, including disciplinary actions.


However, if you're seeking redressal for any pecuniary losses or damages you suffered as a result of your lawyer's negligence, you might be able to approach the consumer court. But it's essential to consult with a lawyer or a legal expert to determine the best course of action.


If you're not seeking pecuniary relief, you can directly approach the Bar Council of India to file a complaint against your lawyer.


Would you like me to guide you on drafting a complaint to the Bar Council of India, or would you like to explore other options?


Human: I want monetary compensation for the harm caused against him. What can I do?


AI: In that case, you can approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which has jurisdiction over pecuniary matters up to 1 crore rupees. Since the issue with your lawyer involves a dispute over his services, you may be able to approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum for monetary compensation.


Before proceeding, I can help you draft a legal notice to Adv. Harish Singh, stating your grievances and seeking compensation. However, please note that the legal notice is not a mandatory step, and you can directly file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.


If you'd like, I can guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice or help you file a complaint with the consumer forum.


Also, remember that you can contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or through their online portal at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/ for further assistance and guidance on the process.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) if the matter exceeds 1 crore rupees but does not exceed 10 crores rupees.

AI: As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you need to file the complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) that has jurisdiction over the matter.


Since Adv. Harish Singh practices in the Dwarka Court, Delhi, you can file the complaint with the Delhi State Commission or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), depending on the value of the claim.


**Option 1: Delhi State Commission**

Before filing the complaint, ensure that you attach all the required documents, including proof of engagement, correspondence with Adv. Harish Singh, and any other relevant evidence.


You can also file the complaint online through the e-daakhil portal or through the UMANG app.


Do you want to proceed with filing the complaint, or do you have any further questions or modifications you'd like to make?


Human: It seems unclear to me as to what the correct forum is. So the compensation I want is 2.5 crores. Based on this, what would be the forum?


AI: Based on the compensation amount you're seeking, which is 2.5 crores, you can file the complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC).


As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the NCDRC has jurisdiction to hear complaints where the value of the goods or services or the compensation claimed exceeds 2 crores rupees.


Therefore, you can file the complaint with the NCDRC, which has the authority to hear and decide on your case.


I can guide you on the next steps, including filing the complaint with the NCDRC and providing any additional information or documentation that may be required.


Additionally, I can offer to help you draft a covering letter or a petition to be filed with the NCDRC, which will outline the details of your case and the relief you're seeking.


Would you like me to assist you with drafting the covering letter or petition, or would you like to proceed with filing the complaint on your own?


Human: but is 2.5 crores reasonable? 


AI: The reasonableness of the compensation amount of 2.5 crores is subjective and depends on various factors, including the severity of the harm caused, the impact on your life, and the potential loss of income or financial benefits.


In consumer disputes, the compensation amount is usually determined based on the principles of fairness, justice, and proportionality. The court may consider various factors, such as:


* The degree of negligence or fault on the part of the respondent (Adv. Harish Singh)
* The severity of the harm caused to you
* The potential loss of income or financial benefits
* The impact on your life and well-being

Human: I have only suffered mental agony because an ex-parte decree for restitution of conjugal rights was passed and I do not want to cohabit with my husband.


AI: In that case, the harm caused by the ex-parte decree is primarily emotional and psychological, rather than financial.


To justify the compensation amount, you may want to consider the following factors:


1. **Emotional distress**: Calculate the emotional distress you've suffered as a result of the ex-parte decree, including anxiety, depression, and other related mental health issues.
2. **Loss of autonomy**: Consider the loss of autonomy and control over your life due to the ex-parte decree.
3. **Impact on relationships**: Assess the impact of the ex-parte decree on your relationships with family and friends.
4. **Impact on daily life**: Consider how the ex-parte decree has affected your daily life, including changes in your routine, habits, and overall well-being.


When calculating the compensation amount, you may want to consider the following approaches:


1. **Per diem damages**: Calculate the daily emotional distress you've suffered, such as the number of days you've felt anxious or depressed, and multiply it by a fair daily rate.
2. **Compensatory damages**: Calculate the actual losses you've incurred, such as medical bills, therapy sessions, or other related expenses.
3. **Punitive damages**: Consider the amount of damages intended to punish the respondent (Adv. Harish Singh) for his negligence.


To support your claim, you may want to gather evidence, such as:


1. **Medical records**: Collect medical records, including therapy sessions, medication, and other related medical expenses.
2. **Witness statements**: Gather witness statements from family and friends who can attest to the impact of the ex-parte decree on your life.
3. **Journal or diary entries**: Collect journal or diary entries that document your emotional distress and feelings.


I can help you review and organize your evidence, as well as provide guidance on justifying the compensation amount. Do you want to proceed with preparing your evidence and justification, or would you like to discuss further?

Human: Hello, I ordered a product from amazon which showed that it was on sale. The website advertised it as if the mrp was 300 rupees and the product was being sold by amazon on 250rs. However, after I received the product, I found out that the product mrp was 250rs and there was no sale. Can I take legal action against amazon?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd like to help you with this issue.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led you to believe that the product was on sale? Was it the website's description, the price displayed, or something else?

AI: It seems like Amazon showed a misleading advertisement, which is a violation of consumer protection laws in India. 


Can you please tell me when you ordered the product and when you received it? This will help me determine if the incident is within the 2-year statute of limitations for filing a complaint.

Can you please provide me with some information about Amazon? I'll need to know the name of the product and the order number (if you have it) to help you with the next steps.


Human: The Name of the Product was - MRP Adult Bat and the order number was B28183

Human: hey! I have a tech advisory company. we were using cloud storage provided by ABC company. Our contract was till December 31 of this year. However, they stopped providing us services without any reason this month. What do I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help.  Please share more details. What led to the issue with the tech advisory company's cloud storage from ABC company? Was there a previous issue or a misunderstanding?


Human: They initially informed us through email that there was some internal issue which required maintenance. But that was all, we did not get any further information. 


AI: It seems like they initially informed you about a maintenance issue but didn't follow up with any further information or resolution.  That's concerning. What is the date of the email and when exactly did they stop providing the services? Also, what is the current date?


Human: 3rd September 2024 they stopped providing us cloud storage, 5th September we got the email


AI: The incident happened on September 3, 2024, and you received the email on September 5, 2024. That's a short time gap between the disruption and the notification.  As a consumer, you have the right to seek redressal for such incidents. Do you have any contact information for the customer support of ABC company?


Human: it is on their website and we did try talking to them. Despite several reassurances that they will continue their services, nothing has happened. They also failed to provide a clear reason for the disruption.


AI: It seems like you've already tried reaching out to their customer support, and they provided some assurance but failed to follow through. The lack of a clear reason for the disruption is also concerning. Since the incident happened in September 2024, please note that you have up to two years to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.


Before we proceed, have you considered the possibility that the service might be restored? Are you looking for a refund or compensation for the disruption caused to your business?


Human: We would want to repudiate the contract, seek refund and compensation for the losses in business. 


AI: It seems like you're looking to terminate the contract, get a refund for the unutilized services, and claim compensation for the losses incurred due to the disruption. Before moving forward with legal action, I would suggest sending a formal notice to ABC company, stating your grievances and seeking a resolution.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a notice? This will help you clearly state your demands and give the company an opportunity to respond and resolve the issue amicably.


Additionally, I would like to inform you that you can also reach out to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process and provide more information on consumer rights and remedies.


Is there anything else you'd like to know or any further assistance you need?


Human: can our contract restrict us from taking any legal action outside it?


AI: As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and the Indian Contract Act, 1872, any clauses that restrict consumers from taking legal action or limit the time to do so are considered unfair and are not enforceable.


However, it's essential to review your contract carefully to ensure that it doesn't contain any such clauses. If you're unsure, you may want to consult a legal expert.


Concerning the question you asked before: ""Can I be asked to waive the claim under the Act?"" Waiving a claim under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 may be considered unfair as it's a broad definition of unfair contracts outlined in the Act.


Human: alright. Can you help me draft the legal notice? how do I send it?


AI: I can guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice. Here's a general outline:


1. **Heading**: Clearly mention the subject of the notice, which is the termination of the contract and seeking a refund and compensation.
2. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce yourself and your company, and state the purpose of the notice.
3. **Details of the contract**: Mention the contract's details, including the date it was signed, the duration, and any relevant clauses.
4. **Description of the issue**: Describe the issue with the cloud storage services, including the date they were stopped and the lack of proper notice.
5. **Demands**: Clearly state your demands, which include:
        * Termination of the contract
        * Refund for the unutilized services
        * Compensation for the losses incurred due to the disruption
6. **Timeframe**: Specify a reasonable timeframe for ABC company to respond and resolve the issue.
7. **Consequences**: Mention the consequences of not receiving a response or resolution within the specified timeframe.


Here's a sample format:


**[Your Company's Letterhead]**


**[Date]**


**ABC Company**
**[Their Address]**


**Subject: Termination of Contract and Demand for Refund and Compensation**


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Cloud Storage Services Contract


We are writing to inform you that we are terminating our contract for cloud storage services with your company, effective immediately. This decision has been taken due to the disruption in services, which has caused significant losses to our business.


As per our contract, the services were supposed to continue until December 31, 2024. However, on September 3, 2024, the services were stopped without any prior notice or explanation. We have been trying to get in touch with your customer support, but unfortunately, we have not received a satisfactory response.


We demand that you:


1. Terminate the contract immediately
2. Refund the unutilized services for the remaining period
3. Provide compensation for the losses incurred due to the disruption


We expect a response from your company within 15 days from the date of this notice. If we do not receive a satisfactory response, we will be forced to take further action to protect our rights as consumers.


Please find attached a copy of our contract for your reference.


Yours faithfully,


**[Your Name]**
**[Your Designation]**
**[Your Company's Name]**


As for sending the notice, you can send it by registered post with return receipt requested, or via email, depending on your preference. Make sure to keep a record of the notice, including the date it was sent and the method of delivery.


Please note that this is a general outline, and you should consult a legal expert to ensure that your notice is tailored to your specific situation and complies with the relevant laws and regulations.


Human: our contract says that the contract can be terminated only when both parties agree. 


AI: In that case, you may need to handle the situation differently. Since the contract states that termination can only be done by mutual agreement, you would typically need to send a notice to ABC company proposing termination and settlement, and then wait for their response.


However, considering the circumstances, you may want to argue that the disruption in services constitutes a material breach of contract, which may entitle you to terminate the contract unilaterally. But this would require a detailed analysis and possibly legal advice.


In the meantime, you may want to draft a revised notice that proposes termination and settlement, but also flags the potential for contractual disputes if the issue is not resolved. Here's a sample:


**[Your Company's Letterhead]**


**[Date]**


**ABC Company**
**[Their Address]**


**Subject: Proposal for Termination and Settlement of Cloud Storage Services Contract**


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Cloud Storage Services Contract


We are writing to propose that we terminate our contract for cloud storage services, effective immediately, due to the significant disruptions in services that have occurred. We had previously informed you of our concerns, but unfortunately, we have not received a satisfactory response.


As per our contract, we believe that the disruptions in services constitute a material breach, which entitles us to terminate the contract unilaterally. However, we are willing to consider an amicable termination and settlement, provided that you agree to refund the unutilized services and compensate us for the losses incurred due to the disruptions.


Please confirm your acceptance of our proposal by [date]. If we do not receive a response or a satisfactory settlement, we reserve the right to pursue further action to protect our rights as consumers.


Please note that this proposal is made in light of the disruptions in services, and we reserve the right to assert our contractual rights if the issue is not resolved.


Yours faithfully,


**[Your Name]**
**[Your Designation]**
**[Your Company's Name]**


Again, please consult a legal expert to ensure that your notice is properly drafted and compliant with the relevant laws and regulations.


Human: in case they do not respond agreeably, what can be my course of action?


AI: If ABC company does not respond agreeably to your proposal for termination and settlement, you have several options:


1. **File a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)**: As a consumer, you have the right to file a complaint with the NCDRC, which is the highest consumer redressal forum in India. You can file an online complaint on the NCDRC website or through the UMANG app.
2. **File a complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission**: If you are not satisfied with the NCDRC's jurisdiction, you can file a complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which has jurisdiction over your state or territory.
3. **File a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum**: If the value of your claim is below the jurisdiction of the State Commission, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which has jurisdiction over your district.
4. **Take legal action**: If you are not satisfied with the above options, you can take legal action against ABC company by filing a civil suit in a court of law.


Before taking any of these steps, it is recommended that you consult with a consumer rights lawyer who can guide you through the process and help you prepare your case.


Additionally, you can also try to escalate the issue to the:


* **Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)**: If the issue is related to telecommunications services, you can file a complaint with TRAI.
* **Data Protection Authority of India (DPAI)**: If the issue is related to data protection or privacy, you can file a complaint with DPAI.
* **Information Technology Act, 2000**: If the issue is related to computer-related crimes, you can file a complaint under the IT Act.


Please note that these options are not mutually exclusive, and you can try to pursue multiple avenues simultaneously.


Human: alright, thank you


AI: It was my pleasure to assist you. I hope you're able to resolve the issue with ABC company and receive the compensation you're entitled to. Remember to keep a record of all your communications and correspondence with ABC company, as these may be needed as evidence in case you need to file a complaint or take further action.


If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your case!


Also, remember to contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can provide you with more information and guidance on consumer rights and remedies."

Human: I had purchased an online course for 1 lakh that was for 3 months. In the second month, they started asking me for additional 50,000, saying that if I do not provide the money, they will withhold my certificate. What do I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd like to help you understand your options. 


Can you please tell me the approximate time when this incident occurred?


Human: The course started on 1 February 2024. The demand for additional money was made on 05 March 2024. The course ended on 30 April 2024 and I still have not received my certificate,


AI: Thank you for providing the timeline. Since the demand for additional money was made on 05 March 2024, and you have not received your certificate yet, it seems like the issue is still ongoing.


Based on the information you've provided, it appears that the educational institute is demanding additional money for the course, which seems unfair. 


Can you please tell me more about the opposing party (the online course provider)? What is their name, and do they have any contact details?


Human: The course provider is DEF company, based in Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi. I bough their course through their website.


AI: Thank you for providing more information about the course provider.


It seems like you're dealing with an unfair practice by the course provider. Demanding additional money for a course without providing any additional services or benefits is not acceptable.


You deserve to receive your certificate, and you may be eligible for a refund of the additional amount demanded by the course provider.


Based on the Consumer Protection Act, you have several options:


1. If you're not satisfied with the course provider's response, you can draft a legal notice to them, stating your grievances and demanding a refund or your certificate.
2. If the course provider continues to be unresponsive, you can approach the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in your area, which may be located in New Delhi.


Before moving forward, what kind of relief are you seeking from the course provider? Are you looking for a refund of the additional amount demanded, your certificate, or something else?


Human: I stay in Nagarbhavi, Bangalore.


AI: Since you stay in Nagarbhavi, Bangalore, and the course provider is based in Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission or the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum in Bangalore.


Additionally, you can also reach out to the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000 or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance.


Before we proceed further, I would like to offer you some soft remedies. Have you considered reaching out to the course provider's customer support or grievance redressal department to resolve the issue amicably?


If you're not satisfied with their response or if the issue persists, we can discuss further steps, including drafting a legal notice or filing a complaint with the consumer court.


Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss regarding your situation?


Human: I have emailed them multiple times but they have maintained that they need additional money or else they will not issue me the certificate. However, there was no mention of this additional money in the initial agreement. I want the certificate and compensation of Rs 20,000 for mental agony.


AI: It seems like the course provider is being uncooperative and is trying to extract more money from you, even though it was not mentioned in the initial agreement.


In this case, it appears that you have a valid ground for complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, specifically section 2(1)(g) which defines a service as including the provision of facilities in connection with an educational program.


Given the circumstances, it seems that you have a strong case for demanding your certificate and compensation for mental agony.


I can assist you in drafting a legal notice to the course provider, stating your grievances and demanding relief. Would you like me to provide you with a draft legal notice?


Also, I would like to remind you that you have the option to file a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bangalore, or the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, if the issue is not resolved amicably.

Demand for Certificate and Compensation for Unfair Trade Practices


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Demand for Certificate and Compensation for Unfair Trade Practices


This notice is issued by us, [Your Name], to DEF Company, with its office at Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi, with regard to our enrollment in the online course offered by your company.


We had enrolled in the online course on [Date of Enrollment], which was supposed to end on [Date of Completion]. However, despite completing the course, you have refused to issue us our certificate, citing an additional payment of Rs. 50,000.


We strongly object to this demand, as it was not mentioned in the initial agreement or any subsequent communication. This is an unfair trade practice, and we demand that you issue us our certificate immediately.


Furthermore, we have suffered mental agony and distress due to your company's unfair practices. We hereby demand a compensation of Rs. 20,000 for the same.


We hereby give you 15 days' notice to comply with our demands. Failure to do so will lead us to initiate legal proceedings against your company.


You are required to confirm in writing, within 15 days of receipt of this notice, that you will comply with our demands.


Please note that we have the option to file a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, if the issue is not resolved amicably.


Sincerely,


[Your Name]


Please note that this is just a draft, and you should modify it according to your specific needs and circumstances. Also, please make sure to keep a copy of the notice for your records.


Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify in the draft notice?


Human: can I directly approach the Karnataka State Consumer forum?


AI: Yes, you can directly approach the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSCDRC) to file a complaint against DEF Company.


However, before filing a complaint, you should ensure that you have exhausted all other avenues, including:


1. Giving a final opportunity to the company to resolve the dispute amicably.
2. Serving a legal notice to the company, as we drafted earlier.


If you still wish to approach the KSCDRC directly, you can do so by following these steps:


1. Download the complaint form from the KSCDRC website: [www.karunadakshatra.gov.in](http://www.karunadakshatra.gov.in)
2. Fill in the form accurately and completely, providing all the necessary details.
3. Attach supporting documents, such as proof of purchase, communication records, and any other relevant evidence.
4. Submit the complaint form and supporting documents to the KSCDRC office in Bangalore.


You can find the address and contact details of the KSCDRC in Bangalore on their website.


Before filing a complaint, I would like to remind you that the KSCDRC has jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed Rs. 1 crore. Since the amount involved in your case is less than Rs. 1 crore, you can file a complaint with the KSCDRC.


Additionally, you can also reach out to the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) at 1800-11-4000 or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance.


Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss regarding your situation?

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to guide you through the process.


It seems like there's been a miscommunication or a mistake in your hair transplant surgery. The doctor performed the procedure on the frontal hair area instead of the crown area, which is not what you had asked for.


Can you please tell me the approximate time of the incident? You mentioned 22/02/2022, but I want to confirm if it's more than 2 years old, as there's a statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India. Today's date is 01/10/2024.


Human: yes, it was on 22/02/2022


AI: Since the incident occurred more than 2 years ago, I want to caution you that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years. This means you might have missed the deadline to file a complaint with the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC).


However, before we proceed, I'd like to know if you've already approached the hospital or the doctor to resolve this issue. Did you try to speak with the hospital administration or the doctor directly to express your concerns and seek a satisfactory outcome? 


Also, I'd like to know if you've received any follow-up treatment or consultations from the hospital or the doctor regarding your hair transplant surgery.


Human: I emailed the hospital and the doctor but they ignored me 


AI: It's unfortunate that the hospital and the doctor ignored your emails. This lack of response suggests that they might not be willing to resolve the issue amicably.


Given the situation, you have several options, as mentioned in the context provided:


1. Reach out to the Medical Superintendent (M.S) of Fortis Hospital, Nagarbhavi, with a copy of your complaint to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO)/ Civil Surgeon of your area.
2. If dissatisfied with the response from the Medical Superintendent, you can write a complaint to the State Medical Council (SMC).


Before proceeding with any of these options, I'd like to know what kind of relief you're seeking. Are you looking for a refund, compensation for the unsatisfactory outcome, or a re-do of the hair transplant surgery?


Human: I'm looking for compensation 


AI: You're looking for compensation for the unsatisfactory outcome of the hair transplant surgery. Since you've already emailed the hospital and the doctor, and they ignored you, it's likely that a peaceful resolution won't be possible.


Before we proceed with filing a complaint, I'll provide you with some soft remedies that might help. You can try:


1. Writing a formal complaint letter to the hospital's customer service department, detailing the incident, and requesting compensation.
2. Seeking a second opinion from a different doctor or hair transplant specialist to assess the damage and provide a report.
3. Documenting your expenses related to the hair transplant surgery, including any follow-up treatments or consultations.


If these soft remedies don't work, I can guide you through the process of drafting a formal complaint to be filed with the State Medical Council (SMC) or the National Health Portal's Grievance Redressal mechanism.


Let me provide you with a draft of a formal complaint letter. Would you like me to proceed with that?


Also, I'd like to inform you that you can reach the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. If you're located in Bangalore, you can also contact the Bangalore Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum for help.


Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss regarding your situation?


Human: help me draft a complaint 


AI: To draft a complaint, I'll need some more information. Please provide me with the following details:


1. Your name and contact information (address, phone number, email)
2. The name and contact information of the hospital (Fortis Hospital, Nagarbhavi) and the doctor involved
3. A clear description of the incident, including the date (22/02/2022), the procedure that was performed, and the unsatisfactory outcome
4. The relief you're seeking (compensation)
5. Any relevant supporting documents, such as receipts, emails, or medical records


Once I have this information, I can help you draft a formal complaint letter.


Also, please note that the complaint letter should include the following:


* Your name and contact information
* The name and address of the hospital and the doctor
* A clear description of the incident and the unsatisfactory outcome
* The relief you're seeking

",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHPJZCScJuj6YCJsHkiYFs6_BaNabgkjjvyyh3u2neY/edit?usp=sharing,"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I had bought a flat on 23.06.2020 the possession of which was to be given to be in 15 months as per the initial advertisements and agreement. However, I have still not received possession. Even the construction of the apartments is far from completion. What can I do now?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help.


Firstly, I want to inform you that the two-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer case has not expired yet, considering the incident occurred on 23.06.2020 and today's date is 01.10.2024. However, I would recommend acting promptly to avoid any potential issues.


Can you please tell me what prompted you to take action now, and have you already tried contacting the builder or CREDAI for assistance?


Human: I have been waiting for long, hoping that the possession is handed over but it has been more than 2 years since I was due to receive it. It has caused me extreme hardship. This was supposed to be our first own house but I am being forced to stay at rent despite having made most of the payment for the apartment flat. I have been constantly emailing and calling the builder but they keep making false promises, telling me that the construction will be over just in a month


AI: It's distressing to hear about the impact this situation has had on you and your family. The builder's repeated false promises and lack of action are unacceptable.


Given the delay is more than 2 years beyond the agreed possession date, it seems you have a strong case for filing a complaint against the builder. As per the Supreme Court's ruling in Imperia Structures ltd. v. Anil Patni, the failure of the developer to comply with the contractual obligation to provide the flat within a contractually stipulated period amounts to a deficiency of service.


Before we proceed with filing a complaint, can you please confirm if you have any communication or agreements in writing from the builder regarding the delay, penalty, or compensation? If not, we should consider drafting a formal complaint and notice to the builder.


Human: There is a penalty cause in the agreement but the builder has, in multiple communications, argued that he will not be covered by it because the delay is due to force majeure. I have 3 emails of the builder with me where he gave me false assurances that the possession will be handed over timely or as soon as possible.


AI: The builder's argument about force majeure and their refusal to abide by the agreement's penalty clause are red flags. Having written communication from the builder, including emails, is crucial evidence in this case.


It seems like you have a solid basis for filing a complaint against the builder for deficiency of service and breach of contract. We can use these emails and the agreement to support your claim.


Considering your situation, I recommend drafting a formal complaint and notice to the builder. We can also explore other options, such as filing a complaint with the Consumer Forum or approaching CREDAI for assistance.


Can you please tell me how much you have paid to the builder so far, and do you have any estimates or documentation regarding the remaining construction costs or the expected completion date?


Human: what is the CREDAI and how can they help?


AI: CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India) is an association formed by developers and builders in India for self-regulating the business of real estate. They have adopted a voluntary standard code of conduct aspiring towards ethical business practices.


While CREDAI is not a government agency, they can provide assistance in mediating disputes between builders and consumers. However, it's essential to note that CREDAI's mediation process is not binding, and you may still need to pursue legal action if a resolution is not reached.


CREDAI can help in the following ways:


1. Mediation: They can facilitate a discussion between you and the builder to resolve the issue amicably.
2. Code of conduct: CREDAI's code of conduct provides a framework for builders to adhere to, which can be useful in resolving disputes.
3. Information and guidance: CREDAI can provide you with information about your rights as a consumer and the necessary steps to take in case of a dispute.


You can register a complaint on CREDAI's portal using the following link: https://credai.org/register-your-complaint


However, considering the severity of the situation and the builder's repeated false promises, I would recommend filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Forum or drafting a notice to the builder as a next step.


Would you like me to help you draft a notice to the builder, or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint with the Consumer Forum or CREDAI's mediation process?


Human: I had already sent a legal notice which was replied with the same argument, that the delay was outside the control of the builder and possession will be given as soon as possible. Maybe we should straight away draft a cmplaint?


AI: It seems like the builder's response to the legal notice is not satisfactory, and they are not taking responsibility for the delay.


Drafting a complaint is a good next step. We can use the information you've provided and the evidence you have, such as the emails and the agreement, to support your claim.


Before we proceed, I would like to confirm that you would like to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Is that correct?


Also, are you aware of the format of the complaint that needs to be filed? We can use the format provided by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (DCDRC) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC), or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) format, depending on the jurisdiction.


Additionally, we will need to specify the relief you are seeking from the builder. What would you like to achieve through this complaint? Please let me know, and I will help you draft the complaint accordingly.


Here is a basic outline of the complaint:


1. Introduction: Briefly introduce the issue and the parties involved.
2. Statement of facts: Clearly state the facts of the case, including the agreement, the delay, and the builder's promises.
3. Cause of action: Specify the cause of action, i.e., the builder's deficiency of service and breach of contract.
4. Relief: Specify the relief you are seeking from the builder.
5. Evidence: Attach the relevant documents, such as the agreement, emails, and any other evidence that supports your claim.


Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to proceed with drafting the complaint.


Human: I would want the possession to be handed over and compensation of Rs 40 lakhs for mental agony caused


AI: Based on the information you've provided, I'll help you draft a complaint. Please note that this is a basic draft, and you may need to modify it according to your specific situation and the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum.

Human: I hired a landscaping company to install a patio, but they used low-grade materials instead of the premium ones specified in the contract. When I confronted them, they claimed I approved the substitution verbally.


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me.  It seems to be a consumer grievance related to a service provider. I'm here to help you resolve the issue.


To better understand the situation, could you please tell me what led to the issue? How did you discover that they used low-grade materials instead of the premium ones specified in the contract?


Human: they gave me the bill, and i noticed they had used lower grade materials 


AI: You noticed the discrepancy when you received the bill from the landscaping company. That's a good catch.


Can you please tell me when you received the bill? Is it a recent development, or did you receive it a while back? Also, I would like to remind you that for consumer grievances, the statute of limitations is 2 years. Please let me know the date when you received the bill, and I can guide you further.


Human: i got it 8 months ago


AI: You received the bill 8 months ago, which is still within the 2-year statute of limitation for consumer grievances. That's good news.


Could you please tell me a little bit about the landscaping company? For example, what is the company name, and do you have any contact information for them? This will help me better understand your situation and provide you with guidance.

Human: no i did not. in fact i specifically said i wanted higher grade materials


AI: You clearly stated that you wanted higher-grade materials, and there was no verbal approval given by you for the substitution. That's a crucial detail.


It seems like the company, AppleOrange, might be trying to justify their actions by saying you gave verbal approval, which is not true. This is a clear case of a service provider not adhering to the terms of the contract.

Human: I enrolled in a premium online course, but after completion, I discovered that much of the content was copied from free resources available online. The course was marketed as 'exclusive content.' Can I get a refund?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to assist you in addressing this issue. Can you please tell me when you enrolled in the course and when you discovered that the content was copied? This will help me understand the timeline of the issue.


Human: i enrolled 1 year ago, and found out last week


AI: As per the Consumer Protection Act, the time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the occurrence of the incident. Since you discovered the issue only last week, you can still file a complaint. However, it's essential to act swiftly to ensure that you don't miss the opportunity to pursue your claim.


Before we proceed, I'd like to know more about the course provider. Could you kindly tell me the name of the online course provider and any other relevant details, such as their contact information? This information will help me provide you with more specific guidance.


Human: AppleOrange, based in Bengaluru


AI: Thank you for providing the details. I don't have any information about the contact details or the address of AppleOrange. However, you can try searching for their contact information online or checking their website for a contact page or email address. You can also check if they have a social media presence and try reaching out to them through those channels.


As a consumer, you have the right to seek a refund or compensation if you've been deceived or misled by the course provider. Given that the course was marketed as having ""exclusive content"" but turned out to be copied, you may have a strong case.


Before we proceed with filing a complaint, I'd like to know what you would like to achieve from this process. Are you seeking a full refund, a partial refund, or some other form of compensation?


Human: full refund


AI: You're seeking a full refund for the course. I can guide you through the process of seeking a refund through a formal complaint.


Before we proceed, I'd like to suggest that you first try to contact AppleOrange directly and explain the situation to them. You can send them a formal email or a letter stating the issue and requesting a full refund. This approach may resolve the issue amicably, and you may receive your refund without needing to file a formal complaint.


If AppleOrange doesn't respond or refuses to provide a refund, we can explore other options, including filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the e-daakhil portal.


Would you like me to help you draft a formal notice to AppleOrange, stating the issue and requesting a full refund?


Human: yes 


AI: Here's a draft notice that you can use as a template:


**Notice of Dispute**


To AppleOrange
[Address of AppleOrange, Bengaluru]


Subject: Refund of Course Fees due to Unfair Trade Practices


Dear Sir/Madam,


I am writing to you to report a serious issue with the online course, [Name of the course], which I enrolled in on [Date of enrollment] through your platform. As a consumer, I was misled by your marketing claims that the course content was exclusive and original, but unfortunately, I discovered that much of the content was copied from free resources available online.


As a result, I request a full refund of the course fees, which I believe is a fair and reasonable outcome given the circumstances. I kindly request that you take immediate action to refund my course fees and provide a formal apology for the distress and financial loss caused by your unfair trade practices.


I would appreciate it if you could acknowledge receipt of this notice and confirm the steps you will take to resolve this matter. If I do not receive a satisfactory response from you within the next 30 days, I will be forced to explore further action, including filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline and the e-daakhil portal.


Please note that I have attached a document with the details of my course enrollment and the evidence of the copied content.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or clarification.


Human: who would have jurisdiction over my complaint


AI: Based on your complaint, the jurisdiction would likely be with the **State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (State Commission)** or the **District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District Commission)**.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the jurisdiction of consumer commissions is divided into three levels:


1. **District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District Commission)**: Handles cases where the total value claimed (i.e., the value of the goods or services + the value of compensation claimed) does not exceed ₹ 50,00,000 (₹ five lakhs).
2. **State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (State Commission)**: Handles cases where the total value claimed exceeds ₹ 50,00,000 (₹ five lakhs) but does not exceed ₹ 2,00,00,000 (₹ two crores).
3. **National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (National Commission)**: Handles cases where the total value claimed exceeds ₹ 2,00,00,000 (₹ two crores).


Based on your complaint, it appears that the jurisdiction would likely be with the State Commission, as the total value of the disputed amount is likely to be more than ₹ 50,00,000 (₹ five lakhs) but less than ₹ 2,00,00,000 (₹ two crores).


However, please note that the jurisdiction may vary depending on the specific details of your complaint and the applicable laws and regulations.


To confirm the jurisdiction, you may want to consult with a consumer rights expert or a lawyer who specializes in consumer law.

Human: I hired a lawyer to handle my divorce case, but he has been unresponsive for weeks. Also, he gave me poor advice that resulted in a financial loss. Can I take action?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I can see that you're dealing with a situation related to a lawyer's deficiency in service. 


To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to this situation? Was there a specific incident or conversation where your lawyer became unresponsive, or was it a gradual decline in communication?


Human: he's been ignoring my communication attempts for a week now. this was after i confronted him about his advice being terrible and going against all the other opinions i got, he started ignoring me. i've already paid him a considerable amount


AI: It seems like your lawyer's behavior has been unprofessional, and you're seeking redress for the harm caused.


To proceed, can you please tell me when this incident happened? Was it recently or a while back? This is because, in India, consumer complaints have a statute of limitation of 2 years. If the incident is more than 2 years old, you may not be able to file a complaint. Today's date is 2024-10-01.


Human: he has been ignoring me since 2-10-2024


AI: Since the incident occurred recently, you're well within the 2-year statute of limitation.


Moving forward, it would be helpful to gather more information about the lawyer. Do you have any documentation or records of your communication attempts with him, including emails, messages, or phone calls? Additionally, do you have any evidence of the poor advice he provided and the financial loss you incurred as a result?


Human: yes i have all of those things


AI: Having documentation and evidence will be crucial in building a strong case against the lawyer.


Considering your situation, you have a few options to seek relief. Before resorting to litigation, you can try sending a formal notice to the lawyer, detailing the defects in his service and the relief you're seeking. This can be a soft remedy that may prompt him to respond and make amends.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a formal notice to the lawyer? This can be a crucial step in resolving the issue without going to court.


Also, I'd like to remind you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or UMANG App can provide immediate assistance. If you'd like, I can also offer to provide a location-based helpline number for more support.

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. To better assist you, I'd like to ask a few questions. 


Can you please provide the date when you purchased the sunscreen and used it, which led to the sunburn?


Human: purchased in on 9th september, used it on 29th september


AI: You used the sunscreen on September 29th and got a severe sunburn. Did you approach the manufacturing company's customer care to register your grievance yet?


Human: yes, they just said that they were sorry. also, they refused to provide the lab test reports for the sunscreen when i asked. 


AI: It seems like the company's response was not satisfactory. Since they refused to provide the lab test reports, it's possible that the product may not have met the claims made in the product description.


Considering the company's response, I would suggest drafting a legal notice to them, as a formal step to address your grievance. I can help you with the draft of the notice. Would you like me to proceed with that?


Also, please note that you may have two years from the date of purchase to file a consumer complaint. Since your incident occurred on September 29th, you have enough time to take further action.

Human: I am not receiving emails on my email account anymore. My service provider is asking me to pay them or else they I will continue to not receive emails as my storage is full. What can I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. It sounds like you're facing an issue with your email service provider.


Can you please tell me what led to the issue with your email account, such as did you exceed the storage limit accidentally or did you receive a high volume of emails that caused the storage to fill up?


Human: I have been using the services since 2010 and it has always been free. This year, however, they came up with a policy that I would have to pay for storage space more than 15 GB. Since I have been using the email for more than 10 years, of course my storage has already exceeded that. It seems unfair that I am now suddenly being asked to pay for the space I have had.


AI: It sounds like the policy change has affected you unfairly. You've been a loyal customer for over a decade, and it's reasonable to expect that your existing storage space would be grandfathered in.


Can you please tell me when this issue started, i.e., when did you first receive the notification that your storage was full and that you needed to pay for additional space?


Human: I received the first notification in February, 2024.


AI: Since you received the notification in February 2024, you have some time to address this issue. However, I would like to remind you that the Consumer Protection Act in India has a statute of limitations of 2 years for filing a complaint. If you file a complaint now, it's likely to be within the timeframe.


Can you please tell me more about the service provider? Are they a third-party administrator or directly associated with the company? This information might be helpful in understanding the situation better.


Human: I am using gmail, it belongs to Google. They have various services pertaining to the mobile infrastructure which incentivises people to increase storage on their cloud. And now they are askign to pay for it.


AI: You're using Gmail, a widely popular email service provided by Google. Given that Google is a large corporation with various services, it's understandable that they might re-evaluate their policies and pricing structures.


Considering that you've been using Gmail for over a decade and have now been asked to pay for storage space, it's reasonable to expect that your existing storage space should be grandfathered in.


If you're looking for a soft remedy, you could try contacting Google's customer support directly to explain your situation and ask if they can provide any assistance or exemptions. You can also check if they have any promotional offers or discounts that might help.


However, if you'd like to pursue a more formal resolution, you could consider drafting a Notice to Google, highlighting the unfairness of the policy change and requesting that they reconsider their stance.


Would you like me to provide you with a sample draft for a Notice to Google?


Human: I have tried emailing then but they responded by saying that it was a standard policy and that I could continue to use the email if only I removed extra storage but this seems unfair.


AI: It sounds like Google's response was unsatisfactory, and you're right to feel that it's unfair to be asked to remove extra storage just because they're changing their policy.


In this case, since you've already tried contacting Google's customer support and they're not willing to budge, it might be worth considering drafting a formal Notice to Google, highlighting the unfairness of the policy change and requesting that they reconsider their stance.


I can help you with drafting a Notice to Google, which would include the following details:


* A clear statement of the issue and the policy change
* An explanation of how the policy change affects you
* A request for Google to reconsider their stance and grandfather in your existing storage space
* A clear call to action, such as requesting a response or meeting to discuss the issue


Would you like me to help you with drafting a Notice to Google?

Subject: Unfair Policy Change regarding Storage Space in Gmail Account


Respected Sir/Madam,


I am writing to bring to your attention an unfair policy change that has been implemented by Google regarding storage space in Gmail accounts. As a loyal customer of Google, I have been using my Gmail account for over a decade, and it has been my primary mode of communication.


However, recently, I received a notification that my storage space has exceeded the 15 GB limit, and I am being asked to pay for additional storage space. This policy change is unfair and discriminatory towards long-standing customers like myself, who have been using Google's services without any issues.


I request that you reconsider the policy change and grandfather in my existing storage space, allowing me to continue using my Gmail account without any additional charges. I have been a loyal customer for over a decade, and it is only fair that I should be treated with the same level of service that I have received in the past.


I would appreciate it if you could respond to this notice within 30 days, indicating your intention to reconsider the policy change and provide me with a solution.

Human: should I go to the scdrc or the dcdrc


AI: To determine whether you should file a complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (DCDRC), we need to consider the monetary value of the dispute.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the DCDRC has jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed ₹1 crore. If the value exceeds ₹1 crore, you can file a complaint with the SCDRC.


In your case, since you didn't mention the exact amount you paid for the Maggi Instant Noodles, I'll assume it's a small amount, likely under ₹1 crore.


Based on this assumption, I would recommend filing a complaint with the DCDRC. However, please verify the value of the dispute with the relevant authorities or a consumer protection expert to ensure that you're filing with the correct commission.


To find the contact details of the DCDRC in your area, you can visit the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) website: https://ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html. This website provides a list of DCDRCs across India, along with their contact details.


Remember to file a complaint with the DCDRC that has jurisdiction over your area and ensure that you submit all required documents and evidence to support your claim."

Human: I had a routine surgery which was conducted by 2 surgeons, one of them being the head surgeon and the other assisting him. However, after the surgery I experienced discomfort and illness. After doing scans, it was found that a foreign object was left in my body during the surgery. I had to undergo another surgery to have it removed. What should I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


Can you please tell me what led to the issue with the first surgery? Was there any negligence on the part of the hospital, doctors, or surgeons that you're aware of?

AI: That's a serious matter. Leaving a foreign object inside a patient's body is a clear case of medical negligence.


Can you please tell me when did you undergo the first surgery? This is important because the Consumer Protection Act has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. If it's been more than 2 years, it might be challenging to pursue a case. Today's date is 2024-10-08.

Considering the severity of the situation, it's likely that you're entitled to compensation for the additional surgery and any other damages you've incurred. Would you like to consider filing a complaint against Fortis Hospital Nagarbhavi and the doctors involved, or would you like to explore any other options for relief?

This is to bring to your notice that I, [Your Name], had undergone a surgery at your hospital on [date of surgery] under the care of Dr. John Doe (Head Surgeon) and Dr. Jane Doe (Assisting Surgeon). Unfortunately, during the surgery, a piece of metal was left inside my stomach, which was only discovered after subsequent scans.

Human: I'm ready to send the notice. what if they don't respond to the notice


AI: If the hospital and the doctors involved do not respond to the notice, you can proceed with filing a complaint with the State Medical Council (SMC) and the Medical Council of India (MCI). Here's what you can do:


1. **State Medical Council (SMC):** You can file a complaint with the SMC against the doctors involved, Dr. John Doe and Dr. Jane Doe. You can find the contact details of the SMC on the National Medical Commission's website: https://www.nmc.org.in/information-desk/state-medical-councils/list-of-state-medical-councils/.

If you need help with drafting a complaint to the SMC or MCI, I can assist you with that.
should I approach the cdrf or scdrc
Based on your case, I would recommend approaching the **State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC)**. Here's why:


* The value of the goods or services paid as consideration for the surgery exceeds the limit of the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRF), which is ₹1 crore. Since you're seeking compensation for the additional surgery and other damages, the SCDRC has the jurisdiction to hear your case.
* The SCDRC has the authority to grant compensation and other reliefs, such as damages, interest, and costs.


To approach the SCDRC, you'll need to file a complaint in writing, providing details of the incident, the damages suffered, and the relief sought. You can use the complaint letter I helped you draft earlier as a starting point.


Before filing the complaint, I would like to know if you have any questions or need further assistance.


Human: no thank you


AI: You're welcome. If you have any other consumer-related issues or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.


As a final step, I would like to remind you to keep a record of all correspondence with the hospital, doctors, and the SCDRC, including dates, times, and details of conversations. This will help you keep track of the progress and provide evidence if needed.


You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance or to seek guidance on the next steps.

Human: I paid extra for a courier service that promised same-day delivery for a time-sensitive document, but it arrived a day late. There was a huge flood in my area, and the company claims that this is why there was a delay. What are my rights in this situation, and can I claim a refund for the expedited fee?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you understand your rights in this situation.


Can you please tell me what led to the issue with the courier service? Was there any communication from the courier company about the flood before they delivered the document a day late?


Human: yes, they mentioned something on their website about how delays can be expected due to heavy rains. but i paid extra for this, so i expected that mine would not be subject to this delay.


AI: It seems that the courier company had prior knowledge of the flood situation and still charged you extra for same-day delivery.


Can you please tell me when the document was supposed to be delivered and when it actually arrived? This will help me determine if the delay is within the statutory time limit for filing a complaint. (As per the Consumer Protection Act, you have 2 years from the date of the incident to file a complaint.)


Human: it was supposed to arrive yesterday, it arrived today 


AI: Since the document arrived today, the incident is relatively recent, and you still have time to file a complaint.


The courier company's website mention about expected delays due to heavy rains is not a valid reason to deny the same-day delivery service you paid for. You paid extra for a service that was not provided, and the company's website disclaimer is not a valid defense in this case.


Would you like to claim a refund for the expedited fee, or would you like to consider other forms of relief, such as compensation or a discount on future services?


Human: i want a refund 


AI: You can write a complaint to the courier company, stating the issue and requesting a refund for the expedited fee. If they don't respond or don't provide a satisfactory refund, you can escalate the matter to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or file a complaint on the e-daakhil portal.


Before proceeding, I can help you draft a simple complaint letter. Would you like me to provide a draft letter for you to use as a reference?


Also, do you want to know more about the process of filing a complaint on the e-daakhil portal or the National Consumer Helpline?

Human: I am a Make-up artist who bought foundation from a local brand OrganicBrowns. It was branded as organic. However, after using it on my customer, she developed a rash and has filed a complaint against me in the consumer court. I am aggrieved by the defective product of OrganicBrowns, what can I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you with this issue.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the foundation from OrganicBrowns? Was it a one-time incident, or have you noticed any other customers reacting negatively to the product?


Human: she was the first customer I was using it on. She developed an allergy to it. 


AI: It seems like the incident occurred recently, as it was your first time using the product on a customer.


Could you please tell me the date when this incident occurred? Also, please note that under the Consumer Protection Act, you have a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. If the incident is more than 2 years old, it might be challenging to pursue a case.


Additionally, do you have any information about the opposing party, OrganicBrowns, such as their contact details or customer care number?


Human: I used the lipstick on my client on 04 August 2024.


AI: Since the incident occurred on August 4, 2024, you are well within the 2-year time limit to file a complaint.


Now, regarding OrganicBrowns, do you have any contact details, such as their phone number or email, that you can reach out to them with? This will help you to inform them about the issue and possibly resolve it amicably.


Also, what kind of relief are you looking to get from OrganicBrowns? Are you seeking a refund, replacement, or compensation for the damage caused to your business due to the complaint filed against you?


Human: I emailed them on the address available on their website on 20th Auugust 2024 when I got to know my client had a problem. They have not responded to it.


AI: It seems like you've already taken the first step by reaching out to OrganicBrowns via email. Since they haven't responded, it's likely that you'll need to take further action.


Considering that you've already informed them about the issue, you may want to draft a formal complaint to be sent to them, which can be used as a basis for further action. I can help you draft a sample legal notice that you can use as a starting point.


Before we proceed, I'd like to inform you about the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App, which can provide immediate assistance with your consumer-related issues. Would you like me to guide you on how to use these resources?

If you'd like, I can guide you on how to find the state helpline number or provide information on how to use the UMANG App to register your complaint. Alternatively, you can also try searching online for the contact number of your state's consumer protection council or department.


Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your issue with OrganicBrowns?


Human: help me draft a legal notice?


AI: To draft a legal notice, we'll need to include some specific details. Please provide me with the following information:

Subject: Complaint against Defective Product - Organic Foundation


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Incident on 04 August 2024


This is to bring to your notice that on 04 August 2024, I used your Organic Foundation on a client, who subsequently developed an allergic reaction. This has caused harm to my reputation and business.


We request you to take immediate action to rectify this situation by providing a full refund for the defective product and compensating us for the damages suffered.


We request a response within 7 days from the receipt of this notice.

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]


Please note that this is just a sample, and you should modify it according to your specific situation. Also, it's essential to keep a record of the notice and its dispatch, including the date and mode of sending it to OrganicBrowns.


Before sending the notice, I recommend that you keep a copy for your records and consider sending it by registered post to ensure proof of delivery.


Is this template suitable for you, or would you like me to make any changes?


Human: what if they do not respond favourably to it?


AI: If OrganicBrowns does not respond favorably to your legal notice, you may need to file a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCRF) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC), depending on the value of the claim.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, complaints against unfair contracts can be entertained by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) when the amount of value paid exceeds ₹10 crores. However, since the amount is likely to be much lower in your case, you would file the complaint in the DCRF or SCDRC.


I can guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the DCRF or SCDRC, including the necessary documents and procedures. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?


Additionally, you can also consider mediation as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. The Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells to resolve consumer complaints through mediation. I can provide more information on the mediation process if you're interested.


Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.


Human: can I take a legal defence in the case filed against me by my client?


AI: As the person who used the product on your client, you can take a defense in the case filed against you by your client. However, the specific defense you can take will depend on the facts of the case and the laws applicable.


Based on the information you provided earlier, it seems that the issue is with the product (OrganicBrowns' foundation) that caused the allergic reaction. You can consider arguing that the product was defective or had a manufacturing flaw that led to the harm caused to your client.


One possible defense you can take is that the product was not fit for the purpose for which it was intended, and OrganicBrowns is liable for the harm caused. You can also argue that you were not aware of the product's defects and took reasonable care in using it on your client.


However, it's essential to note that you may also be held liable for using a product that you knew or should have known was defective. You can consider consulting with a consumer law expert or a lawyer to determine the best course of action and the specific defenses you can take in the case.


I can provide more information on the possible defenses you can take, but it's always best to consult with a lawyer for personalized advice.


Would you like me to provide more information on the possible defenses you can take, or would you like to consult with a lawyer?


Human: I would consult a lawyer


AI: It's always best to consult with a lawyer to get personalized advice on your specific situation.


In the meantime, I can provide you with some general information on the process of defending yourself in the consumer court.


As a consumer, you have the right to defend yourself in the consumer court. You can represent yourself or hire a lawyer to represent you. If you decide to represent yourself, you should be prepared to present your case and respond to the allegations made by your client.


If you hire a lawyer, they will help you prepare your defense and represent you in court.


Additionally, you can also consider filing a counter-claim against your client for any losses or damages you may have suffered due to the complaint filed against you.


Please keep in mind that this is general information, and it's essential to consult with a lawyer for specific advice on your situation.


Before we conclude, I'd like to remind you that you can also reach out to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for assistance with your consumer-related issues.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: No, thanks


AI: It was my pleasure to assist you with your consumer grievance. If you have any other issues or need further assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.


Remember to keep a record of all correspondence and communication with OrganicBrowns and your client, as well as any progress made in the case. This will be helpful if you need to escalate the matter further.

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To proceed with your case, I need some more information. Can you please tell me what led to your decision to buy this green tea? Was it an online purchase or from a physical store?


Human: It was from a physical store. I wanted to lose weight, become a little healthy, and the tea seemed to align with my interests.


AI: You bought the tea from a physical store, and it was advertised as a slimming tea. 


Since you started using the tea in May 2024, the incident occurred recently. However, I need to inform you that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has a statute of limitations of 2 years for filing a complaint. This means you have until May 2026 to file a complaint. 


Moving forward with your case, I'd like to know more about the company that sold you the tea. Do you have any information about the company, such as their name or contact details?


Human: It was GreenHerbs company. Their phone number is advertised on their packaging. I had tried reaching out to them and they denied any wrongdoing.

In that case, I'd like to know what kind of relief you're seeking from the company. Are you looking for a refund, compensation for the weight gain and back pain, or something else?


Human: I want compensation for ill affects to my health and mind


AI: You're seeking compensation for the physical and mental distress caused by the green tea.


Based on the information provided, it seems like you have a strong case against GreenHerbs company. The company's denial of wrongdoing is not a valid defense, and you have a right to seek compensation for the harm caused.


As a next step, I can help you draft a legal notice to the company, which is a formal document that outlines the complaint and demands compensation. Would you like me to assist you with drafting a legal notice?

Human: I wanted to get enrolled in the State Bar Council. When I submitted my documents, they told me that my college is not recognised by UGC. This was in February 2024.


AI: It seems that the incident occurred in February 2024, which is within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. 


Since the issue remains unresolved with the college authorities, can you please provide me with more information about the opposing party in this case? What is the name of the college, and is there a specific contact person or authority that you have been dealing with regarding this issue?


Human: ABC College, Delhi. I have been emailing and calling their Registrar and the Principal.


AI: It seems that you have been trying to reach out to the authorities at ABC College in Delhi, specifically the Registrar and the Principal.


As the issue is still unresolved, it seems like you may need to take further action. What kind of relief are you looking for in this situation? Are you seeking a refund of your fees, a recognized degree, or something else?


Human: A refund of my 5 years of fees, which amounts to 20 lakhs and compensation for mental agony and time wasted, which I think could be around 60 lakhs.


AI: You're seeking a refund of 20 lakhs, which is the amount you paid for the 5-year course, and also compensation for mental agony and time wasted, which you estimate to be around 60 lakhs.


Given the severity of the situation, it seems like filing a consumer complaint may be a viable option. I can help you draft a legal notice to the college, which is the first step in filing a complaint.


Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the UMANG App are available for immediate assistance with consumer grievances. If you need help with the process, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline.


Would you like me to assist you in drafting a legal notice to the college, or would you like to know more about the process of filing a consumer complaint?


Human: Since a lot of time has passed, I would directly like to file a complaint.


AI: Given the time that has passed, it's best to file a complaint directly. 


As per the information provided, the first step would be to file a complaint with the University or Competent Authority (UGC/AICTE/DEB) since the issue is related to higher education.


I can guide you through the process. However, I would like to clarify that you should first file a complaint with the University (Roho University) since the issue is related to the recognition of the degree.


If the issue persists, you can then escalate it to the UGC or the Competent Authority.


Would you like me to provide you with more information on how to file a complaint with Roho University, or would you like to know more about the process of escalation to UGC or the Competent Authority?


Human: I have already filed a complaint with Roho University and am yet to hear from them. How can I escalate the issue?


AI: Since you have already filed a complaint with Roho University and are yet to hear from them, the next step would be to escalate the issue to the University Grants Commission (UGC).


You can submit a written complaint to the UGC, providing all the necessary details, including the complaint you filed with Roho University and the response (or lack thereof) you received.


The UGC's contact information is not available in the context, but you can find it on their official website. I would suggest searching online for the UGC's contact information and website for further guidance on how to file a complaint.


Additionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) as a final step if the issue persists.


Would you like me to provide you with more information on how to file a complaint with the NCDRC?


Human: Before, that, can you tell me what remedy I can get from UGC? and what does DEB stand for?


AI: The UGC (University Grants Commission) is a regulatory body that can provide relief in cases related to higher education, but their primary role is to regulate and accredit institutions, rather than providing direct remedies to individual students.


However, if you file a complaint with the UGC, they may be able to:


* Direct the institution to take action to resolve the issue
* Provide guidance on the recognition of the degree
* Take disciplinary action against the institution if they find any wrongdoing


Regarding DEB, it stands for Distance Education Bureau. DEB is a regulatory body that oversees distance education programs in India, ensuring that they meet certain standards and norms.


As for remedies, if you file a complaint with the UGC, you may be able to get:


* A refund of your fees
* Recognition of your degree
* Compensation for mental agony and time wasted (although this may depend on the specific circumstances)


However, the UGC's role is more focused on regulating institutions rather than providing direct remedies to students.


Now, would you like me to provide you with more information on how to file a complaint with the NCDRC?


Human: sure


AI: As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) if you are not satisfied with the response from the UGC or the institution.


The NCDRC has jurisdiction over complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration exceeds 10 crores. In your case, since you paid 20 lakhs, you can file a complaint with the NCDRC.


To file a complaint with the NCDRC, you will need to provide the following documents:


* A written complaint detailing the issue and the relief sought
* Proof of payment of fees
* Proof of communication with the institution and UGC
* Any other relevant documents


You can file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal or through the NCDRC's website.


I can help you draft a sample complaint that you can use as a template. Would you like me to assist you with that?


Also, would you like to know more about the process of filing a complaint with the NCDRC or would you like to know more about the next steps?


Human: yes


AI: I can guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the NCDRC.


Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the UMANG App are available for immediate assistance with consumer grievances.


To file a complaint with the NCDRC, you will need to follow these steps:


1. Choose the NCDRC as the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum
2. Fill out the complaint form online or download it from the NCDRC's website
3. Attach all the necessary documents, including proof of payment, communication with the institution and UGC, and any other relevant documents
4. Submit the complaint online or through the NCDRC's website
5. Wait for the NCDRC to acknowledge your complaint and schedule a hearing


I can help you draft a sample complaint that you can use as a template. Would you like me to assist you with that?


Also, I would like to remind you that you can also contact the NCDRC's office directly for assistance. The contact information is available on their website.


Is there anything else I can help you with regarding filing a complaint with the NCDRC?


Human: yes


AI: To draft a sample complaint, I will need some more information from you. Can you please provide me with the following details:


* Your full name and address
* The name and address of the institution (ABC College)
* The name and address of the University (Roho University)
* A brief description of the issue and the relief sought
* The amount of fees paid to the institution (20 lakhs)
* Any other relevant details or documents that you would like to include in the complaint


With this information, I can help you draft a sample complaint that you can use as a template.


Also, I would like to remind you that you can also seek assistance from a consumer protection organization or a lawyer if you need help with drafting the complaint.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: I am Fali Hariman. The other information is with you, right?


AI: As we discussed earlier, the other information is indeed available in our conversation. I can use that to draft a sample complaint for you.


Here's a sample complaint that you can use as a template:

I have attached the following documents in support of my complaint:


* Proof of payment of fees

Human: I deposited an FD with FDC Bank on 20.02.2020 for 15 months. It matured on 20.05.2021. However, without asking me, they reinvested the money when I wanted to open it instead. They are also not offering any interest rate on the reinvested money. The bank has been unhelpful. What do I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was it a misunderstanding or miscommunication with the bank, or was it a deliberate action by the bank that you're unhappy with?


Human: They say it was on my instruction that they reinvested but that was not the case. There is no communication where I consented for the money tobe reinvested.


AI: It seems like there might have been a miscommunication or a lack of transparency on the bank's part. 


Can you please tell me when you first noticed that your FD had been reinvested? Was it when you went to the bank to open it, or did you receive a notice or a statement from the bank earlier?


Human: There was no notice by the bank. I got reminded that the FD must have matured and checked the status myself on 28.05.2021 on my online bank app. That is when I found out that the money was reinvested and locked in for another 15 months without any interest rate.


AI: It's concerning that the bank didn't notify you about the reinvestment and didn't provide any information about the new interest rate.


Since the incident occurred on 20.05.2021, it's within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. 


Can you please tell me about the bank's response when you approached them about this issue? Have they offered any resolution or compensation for the inconvenience caused?


Human: No resolution or compensation. Via their email dated 04.06.2021, they maintain that it was on my instruction that they reinvested.


AI: It seems like the bank is disputing your claim and attributing the reinvestment to your instruction, which you deny.


In this case, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the bank's customer care or the Banking Ombudsman. 


Before we proceed with that, can you please tell me what kind of relief are you looking for? Are you seeking a refund of the interest lost due to the reinvestment, or do you want the bank to reverse the reinvestment and return your money to its original FD term?


Human: I want interest rate of 7% on the money they have reinvested for the duration it has been reinvested for, and compensation of Rs 30,000.


AI: You're seeking a specific interest rate on the reinvested amount for the duration it's been reinvested, as well as a compensation of Rs 30,000 for the inconvenience caused.


Considering the bank's denial of your claim, it's likely that you'll need to take further action. I can help you draft a legal notice to the bank, which is a formal communication that outlines your complaint and the relief you're seeking.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice, or would you like to file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman directly?


Human: yes


AI: I can provide you with a sample draft of a legal notice. However, please note that this is just a template, and you should adjust it according to your specific situation.


Before I provide the draft, I'd like to inform you about the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the UMANG App, which can provide immediate assistance with your complaint. You can also visit the Reserve Bank of India's website for more information on filing a complaint.

Subject: Complaint regarding unauthorized reinvestment of Fixed Deposit and demand for interest and compensation


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Complaint No. [Your Complaint Number, if any]


This is to bring to your notice that I had deposited a Fixed Deposit (FD) with your bank on [Date] for a term of 15 months. However, without my consent or knowledge, the bank reinvested the amount when it matured on [Date]. The bank claims that this was done on my instruction, which is denied by me.


I had specifically instructed the bank not to reinvest the amount, and there is no record of any such instruction being given by me. The bank has also failed to provide me with any notice or communication regarding the reinvestment.


As a result, I have suffered a loss of interest on the reinvested amount, and I am seeking the following relief:


* Interest at the rate of 7% per annum on the reinvested amount for the duration it has been reinvested.
* Compensation of Rs 30,000 for the inconvenience and distress caused.


I request you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and provide me with the relief sought above. If I do not receive a satisfactory response within 30 days from the date of this notice, I shall be forced to approach the Banking Ombudsman and other forums for redressal.


Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and confirm the steps you will take to address this issue.

* A clear description of the issue
* Supporting documents (if required)

AI: I didn't ask for the reason behind their decision, but rather what led to the issue for you. In other words, what happened when you tried to access the service on more than 2 screens? Did you receive an error message, were you blocked, or was it just not working as expected?


Human: A pop-up told me that an error had occured.


AI: So, you experienced an error when trying to access the service on more than 2 screens. That's helpful to know.


Can you please tell me when this incident occurred? Was it recently or a while back? Also, please note that according to the Consumer Protection Act, there is a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. If it's been more than 2 years, it might not be possible to take legal action.


Human: the error occurred on 24.05.2022 for the first time and still continues


AI: Since the issue occurred on 24.05.2022, it's within the 2-year time frame, so you're still within the window to take action.


You've already tried emailing the platform, but they haven't responded. Have you tried contacting their customer support through any other channels, such as phone or social media?


Also, could you please tell me a bit more about YourMovies? What is their company name, and do you have any other details about them, such as their contact address or customer support contact number?


Human: I tried emailing them and calling them but there was no response. Their company name is YourMovies as well, they are based in Los Angeles, USA. They have an email address and phone number on their website.


AI: It's unfortunate that they haven't responded to your attempts to contact them.


Since YourMovies is based in the USA, and you're in India, you might want to consider reaching out to their Indian customer support or a local grievance redressal mechanism. However, since you've already tried contacting them directly, we can explore other options.


Considering the issue is with a subscription service and the platform's failure to honor their promise, we can consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or using the UMANG App for immediate assistance. I can also guide you on drafting a legal notice to YourMovies.


Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief are you looking for? Are you seeking a refund, compensation, or something else?


Human: I want compensation for being unable to access the service as promised for the last 2 years.


AI: You're seeking compensation for the inconvenience and loss of service due to YourMovies not honoring their promise of 3-screen access.


Considering the Consumer Protection Act, you may be eligible for compensation for the deficiency in service. I can assist you in drafting a legal notice to YourMovies, outlining the issue and seeking compensation.


Before we proceed, I want to remind you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the UMANG App can provide immediate assistance and guidance on the process. If you'd like, I can also provide you with a location-based helpline number for your state.


Would you like me to help you draft a legal notice to YourMovies, or would you like to reach out to the National Consumer Helpline for further assistance?


Human: Legal notice


AI: To draft a legal notice to YourMovies, I'll need some more information from you. Please provide me with the following details:


1. Your full name and address
2. YourMovies' registered address (which you mentioned is in Los Angeles, USA)
3. The exact amount of compensation you're seeking (you can provide a specific amount or a range)
4. Any other relevant details you'd like to include in the notice (e.g., specific dates, emails, or phone calls)

Human: I filed a health insurance claim with ABC Insurance for my surgery, which was covered under the policy. However, they rejected the claim stating that the hospital is out of their network, even though their website listed it as part of the network when I purchased the policy. This has left me with an unexpected ₹2 lakh bill. 


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was it a recent development, or did you notice this discrepancy when you first purchased the policy?


Human: i filed my claim 2 weeks ago, and got this response yesterday 


AI: It seems that the incident occurred recently. You filed your claim 2 weeks ago, and the insurance company responded yesterday.


Considering the 2-year statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India, your case is still within the time frame.


Can you please tell me more about the insurance company, ABC Insurance? What is their contact information, if you have it?


Human: they can be contacted at abcinsurancescam@gmail.com


AI: I would advise against relying solely on an email address like abcinsurancescam@gmail.com, as it may not be a legitimate contact method for a company. I recommend checking the company's official website to find their registered office address, contact numbers, and other contact details.

What kind of relief are you seeking from the insurance company? Are you looking for a reversal of the claim rejection, reimbursement of the ₹2 lakh bill, or something else?


Human: why can't i rely on this email address? 


AI: I mentioned that you shouldn't rely on an email address like abcinsurancescam@gmail.com because it's not a secure or official contact method for a company. A legitimate company's contact information usually includes a registered office address, a landline phone number, and a professional email address (often ending with the company's domain name, e.g., @abcinsurance.com).


Using a generic email address like abcinsurancescam@gmail.com may indicate that the company is not transparent about their contact information or may be trying to deceive consumers. I would suggest verifying the company's official contact details from their website or other reliable sources.


Now, regarding your claim, are you looking for a reversal of the claim rejection, reimbursement of the ₹2 lakh bill, or something else?


Human: i want reimbursement 


AI: You want reimbursement of the ₹2 lakh bill.


Considering your situation, you may want to draft a formal complaint to the insurance company. I can guide you through the process of drafting a complaint letter. Would you like me to provide you with a sample complaint letter or notice that you can use as a template?


Additionally, you may also want to consider registering a complaint with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) through their Grievance Redressal Cell. They can help facilitate a resolution to your issue.

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I have a connection with the Delhi Jal Board and they have not been supplying water to me regularly, what can I do?


AI: Sorry to hear that you're facing issues with the water supply from Delhi Jal Board. Thank you for sharing your concern.


To better assist you, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was it a sudden disruption, or has it been a recurring problem?


Human: I have had connection with them from 14 February 2021. The issue has been there from the beginning. I believe it is because of unauthorised connections from the pipeline that is connected to my house. I have brought this to the notice of the Board several times but they have failed to take action on it.


AI: It seems like the issue has been ongoing for a while, and you suspect unauthorized connections from the pipeline might be the cause. Since you've already brought this to the notice of the Delhi Jal Board multiple times, but no action has been taken, it's time to consider the next steps.


As per the information you provided, the incident started on 14 February 2021, which is within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint. However, it's essential to document all your previous communications with the Delhi Jal Board and keep a record of the dates and times of your complaints.


Can you please tell me about the desired relief you're seeking from the Delhi Jal Board? Are you looking for a resolution, compensation, or something else?


Human: I want resolution and compensation of Rs 20,000.


AI: You're seeking a resolution to the issue of unauthorized connections affecting your water supply and compensation of Rs 20,000.


Before we proceed, I'd like to inform you that you can approach the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) for a resolution. These forums can help mediate a resolution and award compensation if the Delhi Jal Board is found to be at fault.


Since you're seeking a specific amount of compensation (Rs 20,000), which is within the limit of Rs 20 lakhs, we can proceed with drafting a legal notice to the Delhi Jal Board.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice, or would you like to file a complaint directly with the consumer forum?


Human: Sure, proceed with drafting a legal notice. But also, why is Rs 20 lakhs relevant?


AI: The Rs 20 lakhs limit is relevant because, according to the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the jurisdiction of the consumer forums is determined based on the value of the goods or services paid as consideration. If the value exceeds one crore rupees, the State Commission has jurisdiction, and if it exceeds 10 crores, the National Commission has jurisdiction. Since you're seeking a compensation of Rs 20,000, which is much lower than one crore rupees, you can approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC).


Now, let's proceed with drafting a legal notice to the Delhi Jal Board. To do this, I'll need some more information. Can you please provide the following details:


1. Your name and address as it appears on your water bill.
2. The date of the first complaint you made to the Delhi Jal Board regarding the unauthorized connections.
3. The name and designation of the person you've been in contact with at the Delhi Jal Board.


This information will help me draft a formal legal notice to the Delhi Jal Board.


Human: My name is Fareeda Kapoor. My first complaint was on 20 May 2021. Then on the dates of 03.07.2021, 13.10.2021 and 26.01.2022.

The reason for the inadequate water supply is suspected to be unauthorized connections from the pipeline connected to my house. I have requested the Board to take necessary action to rectify the issue, but to no avail.

Human: I boarded ABCFlights's flight No AI333 on 03.10.2023 to go on a work trip. I had checked in a suitcase which had a couple of important work documents. However, on reaching my destination (London), I found out that my bag was missing. Because of missing documents, I lost my job. 


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with your baggage? Was it delayed, lost, or damaged during the flight, or was it missing when you arrived at your destination?


Human: It was lost. 


AI: That's concerning. You mentioned that the lost baggage contained important work documents, which ultimately led to you losing your job.


Can you please tell me the date when you first reported the missing baggage to the airline, ABCFlights? Also, did you receive any response or assistance from the airline regarding the missing documents and your lost job?


Human: I reported it on the same day because the work meeting was on 05.10.2023. They told me that the bag was not insured and so they could only pay me Rs 2000 as compensation, which I refused. The amount of damage caused to me is several times more than the compensation they are offering to say. Since I have lost my job, I seek a compensation for Rs 1 lakh at least.


AI: You reported the missing baggage on the same day, which is good. However, I need to inform you that the airline's offer of Rs 2000 as compensation might not be sufficient considering the extent of the damage you've suffered.


As per the information I have, the airline's liability for lost baggage is Rs 3000 per kg. Since you didn't mention the weight of your bag, I'll assume it's a standard scenario. You may want to check with the airline for the actual weight and compensation calculation.


Considering your job loss is a direct consequence of the missing documents, you may have a strong case for claiming higher compensation. I can guide you on drafting a complaint and a legal notice to the airline.


Before we proceed, I'd like to remind you that the statute of limitations for filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since your incident occurred on 03.10.2023, you have until 03.10.2025 to file a complaint.


Would you like me to help you draft a complaint and a legal notice to the airline, seeking compensation of Rs 1 lakh?


Human: The baggage was for 15 kgs. Where is it given that the airline's liability for lost baggage is Rs 3000 per kg?


AI: According to the information I have, the airline's liability for lost baggage is Rs 3000 per kg for loss of baggage, Rs 1000 per kg for delay, and Rs 1000 per kg for damage. However, this information is not explicitly stated as the airline's liability per kg for lost baggage, but rather as the minimum compensation for loss, delay, and damage of baggage.


Considering your 15 kg baggage, the airline's liability for loss would be 15 kg * Rs 3000 per kg, which is a substantial amount. However, you've already refused their offer of Rs 2000, and you're seeking compensation for Rs 1 lakh.


Given the circumstances, I can help you draft a complaint and a legal notice to the airline, seeking higher compensation for the loss of your baggage and its contents, including the job you lost due to the missing documents.


Would you like me to proceed with drafting the documents?


Human: I think that is incorrect. Which law/rules state that the the airline's liability for lost baggage is Rs 3000 per kg for loss of baggage?


AI: I made an error in my previous response. Upon re-reading the information, I see that it states ""Limit of liability to be paid by the airline to be the same for both international and domestic passengers, and the minimum compensation will be as follows: Rs. 3,000 per kg for loss of baggage, Rs. 1,000 per kg for delay and Rs. 1,000 per kg for damage of baggage.""


This information implies that the minimum compensation for lost baggage is Rs 3000 per kg, but it does not explicitly state that the airline's liability is capped at Rs 3000 per kg.


I should not have made an assumption about the airline's liability being capped at Rs 3000 per kg. I will make sure to be more accurate in my understanding of the information provided.


If you would like, I can still assist you in drafting a complaint and a legal notice to the airline, seeking higher compensation for the loss of your baggage and its contents, including the job you lost due to the missing documents.


Human: where are you getting this information from?


AI: I'm getting this information from the context you provided earlier, which includes a list of points related to airline consumer rights and responsibilities. However, I realize now that I made an incorrect assumption about the airline's liability for lost baggage.


To provide more accurate information, I should have checked the provided context more carefully. The correct information about airline liability for lost baggage is actually mentioned in the point ""Baggage lost, delayed, or damaged: a) Limit of liability to be paid by the airline to be the same for both international and domestic passengers, and b) the minimum compensation will be as follows: Rs. 3,000 per kg for loss of baggage, Rs. 1,000 per kg for delay and Rs. 1,000 per kg for damage of baggage.""


I don't have any additional information about airline liability beyond what is provided in the context.


Human: Right, can you help me draft a legal notice?


AI: Based on the information you provided, I can help you draft a basic template for a legal notice. Please note that this is not a substitute for professional legal advice, and you may want to consult with a lawyer to review and finalize the notice.

This notice is to inform you that I, [Your Name], was a passenger on Flight No. AI333, which departed on 03.10.2023. During the flight, my baggage, which was checked in and weighed approximately 15 kg, went missing. Despite reporting the incident to the airline staff on the same day, I have not received any satisfactory response or compensation.


As a result of the loss of my baggage, I suffered significant financial losses, including the loss of my job due to the missing documents. The airline's offer of Rs 2000 as compensation is grossly inadequate, considering the extent of the damage I have suffered.


I hereby demand that the airline takes immediate action to compensate me for the loss of my baggage and consequential losses. I seek a compensation of at least Rs 1 lakh, which I believe is a reasonable amount considering the circumstances.


I request you to take necessary steps to investigate this matter and provide a satisfactory response within 30 days from the date of receipt of this notice.

This notice is to inform you that I, [Your Name], was a passenger on Flight No. AI333, which departed on 03.10.2023. During the flight, my baggage, which was checked in and weighed approximately 15 kg, went missing. Despite reporting the incident to the airline staff on the same day, I have not received any satisfactory response or compensation.


As a direct result of the loss of my baggage, I suffered significant financial losses, including the loss of my job due to the missing documents. The airline's offer of Rs 2000 as compensation is grossly inadequate, considering the extent of the damage I have suffered. The loss of my job was a direct consequence of the airline's negligence in handling my baggage, and I hold them responsible for the same.


I hereby demand that the airline takes immediate action to compensate me for the loss of my baggage and consequential losses. I seek a compensation of at least Rs 1 lakh, which I believe is a reasonable amount considering the circumstances. I also request that the airline takes steps to prevent such negligence in the future to prevent similar incidents from occurring.


I request you to take necessary steps to investigate this matter and provide a satisfactory response within 30 days from the date of receipt of this notice.

Is there anything else you would like to add or modify in the notice?


Human: what happens if they dont respond favourably to it?


AI: If the airline does not respond favorably to the notice, you can consider filing a complaint with the relevant consumer forum or court. In India, the consumer courts have jurisdiction to hear cases related to consumer grievances, including those against airlines.


You can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC), depending on the value of the claim and the jurisdiction of the case.

3.  The consumer court will summon the airline to respond to the complaint, and they will be required to file a written reply within a specified time period.
4.  If the airline fails to respond or does not provide a satisfactory response, the consumer court may proceed to hear the case and pass a judgment in your favor.
5.  If the consumer court finds in your favor, the airline will be required to pay the compensation as ordered by the court.


You can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for assistance and guidance throughout the process.


Additionally, if you're not satisfied with the response from the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF), you can appeal to the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC).


Please note that the process of filing a complaint and pursuing a case through the consumer courts can be time-consuming and may require the assistance of a lawyer. It's recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the process and the potential outcomes.

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: hey, can complaint be filed against educational institutes in consumer fora?


AI: Yes, complaints pertaining to educational institutions can be filed before the Consumer Commissions, as providing education is a service as defined under the Consumer Protection Act.


Human: are you sure?


AI: Yes, I am sure. Providing education is a service as defined under the Consumer Protection Act, and complaints pertaining to educational institutions can be filed before the Consumer Commissions.


Human: it is a public institute


AI: If the educational institute is a public one, then it is not considered a seller or service provider under the Consumer Protection Act. In such cases, the government is not considered a seller or service provider, and therefore, complaints cannot be filed under the Consumer Protection Act.


Human: are you sure?


AI: I made a mistake. Complaints against public educational institutes can indeed be filed under the Consumer Protection Act. However, it would be considered as a case of public authority and not a consumer complaint.


Human: can I consider this legal advice?


AI: I can provide general information on consumer laws and procedures, but I am not a substitute for a qualified lawyer. If you need specific legal advice, I recommend consulting a qualified lawyer who can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation. The information I provide is for general guidance only and should not be considered as legal advice.


Human: is there any law that says that consumer complaint can be filed against public educational institutions?


AI: I couldn't find any specific law that explicitly states that consumer complaints cannot be filed against public educational institutions. In fact, the Consumer Protection Act does not exclude public institutions from its scope. However, the specific activities of public educational institutions, such as conducting exams, issuing roll numbers, determining examination centers, evaluating papers, cancelling candidature, allotting subjects, and declaring results, are considered statutory functions and not services under the Consumer Protection Act.


If you have a complaint against a public educational institution, you may want to consider approaching the relevant authorities or the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for guidance on the best course of action.


Human: alright


AI: I'd like to help you further with your consumer grievance. Can you please tell me what led to the issue with the public educational institution?


Human: they are refusing to refund my admission fees. I havent attended a day of my school.


AI: That sounds like a challenging situation. Can you please tell me when this issue started, or when you paid the admission fees? This will help me understand the timeline of the incident.


Human: I paid my fees on 30 March 2024. The classes started from 04 April 2024. 


AI: Since you paid the fees on 30 March 2024 and classes started on 04 April 2024, I would like to inform you that the Consumer Protection Act has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. As of today's date (08 October 2024), you have more than 6 months to file a complaint. However, I would advise you to file the complaint as soon as possible to avoid any potential issues with the statute of limitations.


Can you please tell me more about the opposing party, i.e., the public educational institution? What is their name and address?


Human: They were ABC Law School College in Amritsar. 


AI: I don't have the address of ABC Law School College in Amritsar. You can try searching online or contacting the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for assistance in obtaining the address.


However, I can guide you on the next steps to take. Since you want a refund of the admission fees, you can start by trying to resolve the issue with the college administration. If that doesn't work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.


Would you like me to help you draft a notice or complaint letter to send to the college?


Human: I tried resolving issue with the college


AI: It's good that you've already tried to resolve the issue with the college. Now, let's move forward with the next steps.


As you're seeking a refund of the admission fees, I would recommend filing a complaint with the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. You can start by drafting a complaint letter or notice to the college, stating your grievances and requesting a refund.


I can help you draft a basic template for the complaint letter. Would you like me to provide you with a sample template?


Human: yes


AI: Here's a basic template for a complaint letter:

Human: I bought a motorcycle. After a month, it started to have problems. I took it to the repair shop multiple times but they were unable to fix it. I turned to the manufacturer of the motorcycle who claim that there’s nothing wrong with it and if there’s any problem, it’s probably due to misuse by me. What do I do?
AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with your issue.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what specifically are the problems you're experiencing with your motorcycle? For example, is it related to any manufacturing defects, faulty components, or something else?
Human: it has maufacturing defect - it does not start properly
AI: It sounds like you're experiencing a problem with your motorcycle's engine starting properly, which could be due to a manufacturing defect.


Can you please tell me when this issue started? Was it immediately after the first month, or did it start a bit later? This will help me understand the timeline of the issue.
Human: after one month from purchase
AI: You purchased the motorcycle about a month ago and started experiencing issues with it. As you mentioned earlier, you've already taken it to the repair shop multiple times, but they couldn't fix the problem. The manufacturer is now saying it's due to misuse, which doesn't seem fair.


Given that the issue started within a month of purchase, I'd like to inform you that the Consumer Protection Act in India has a time limit of 2 years to file a complaint. Since your issue started about a month ago, you're still within this time frame.


Can you please provide me with the details of the manufacturer, such as their name and contact information? This will help me guide you further on how to proceed.
Human: Hero MotoCorp
AI: Hero MotoCorp is a well-known motorcycle manufacturer in India.


Considering the issue with your motorcycle, I would suggest that you draft a formal complaint letter to Hero MotoCorp, stating the problem you're facing and the efforts you've made so far to get it resolved. This will help them understand the issue and take necessary action.


I can help you draft a basic outline for the complaint letter. Would you like me to provide you with a sample template?


Additionally, you may also consider reaching out to the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process and provide more information on how to proceed with your complaint.


Is there anything else you'd like to add or discuss regarding your issue?
Human: draft a consumer complaint
AI: Here's a basic outline for a consumer complaint letter that you can use as a template:


**Complaint Letter**


**To,**


Hero MotoCorp Ltd.,
[Address of Hero MotoCorp Ltd.]


**Subject: Defective Motorcycle - [Your Motorcycle Model and Registration Number]**


Dear Sir/Madam,


I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue with my [make and model] motorcycle, bearing registration number [Registration Number]. I purchased this motorcycle from [Dealer's Name] on [Date of Purchase].


The motorcycle has been experiencing a problem with its engine starting mechanism, which has been causing inconvenience to me. Despite taking it to the authorized service center multiple times, the issue has not been resolved. The service center has informed me that the problem is not with the motorcycle, but with my usage, which I strongly disagree with.


I request you to look into this matter urgently and take necessary action to rectify the issue. I would appreciate it if you could arrange for a replacement or a full refund of the purchase price.


**Details of the issue:**


* Date of purchase: [Date of Purchase]

Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and inform me of the action taken on this matter. If I do not hear from you within 30 days, I will be forced to take further action to protect my consumer rights.


Thank you for your attention to this matter.


Sincerely,


[Your Name]


Please note that this is a basic template, and you should modify it to fit your specific situation. Also, make sure to keep a copy of the complaint letter for your records.


Would you like me to make any changes to this template or provide any further assistance?
Human: not a complaint letter, please draft a consumer complaint to file
AI: Here's a draft of a consumer complaint that you can use to file with the National Consumer Helpline or the e-daakhil portal:


**Consumer Complaint Form**


**Complainant's Details:**


* Name: [Your Name]
* Address: [Your Address]

**Complaint Details:**


* Date of Purchase: [Date of Purchase]
* Registration Number: [Registration Number]
* Model: [Make and Model]
* Description of the issue: The motorcycle has been experiencing a problem with its engine starting mechanism, which has been causing inconvenience to me.
* Date of occurrence: [Date when the issue started]
* Efforts made to resolve the issue: I have taken it to the authorized service center multiple times, but the issue has not been resolved.


**Relief Sought:**


* Replacement of the defective motorcycle or
* Full refund of the purchase price


**Attachments:**


* Proof of purchase
* Service records
* Any other relevant documents


Please note that this is a basic draft, and you should fill in the details accurately and attach all relevant documents. You can file this complaint online through the e-daakhil portal or through the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.


Would you like me to make any changes to this draft or provide any further assistance?
Human: I purchased the bike in 2021 October
AI: Since you purchased the bike in 2021 October, and you're now experiencing issues with it, you're still within the 2-year time frame to file a complaint. However, I would like to remind you that you've already taken it to the authorized service center multiple times, and the issue hasn't been resolved.


Considering this, I would suggest that you file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline or the e-daakhil portal. This will help you to get a formal resolution to your issue and also create a record of your complaint.


Here's a summary of the next steps:


1. You can file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/
2. Alternatively, you can call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance.
3. If you need help with the complaint process or have any questions, I'm here to assist you.


Before we proceed, is there anything else you'd like to add or discuss regarding your issue?
Human: has the limitation period lapsed?
AI: Since you purchased the bike in 2021 October and you're now experiencing issues with it, the limitation period to file a complaint is still not lapsed. However, I notice that the issue started around a month after the purchase, which is within the 2-year time frame.


But, considering the fact that you've already taken it to the authorized service center multiple times and the issue hasn't been resolved, I would suggest that you file a complaint as soon as possible. If the issue is not resolved soon, it might be considered as a defect and you can file a complaint within the 2-year time frame.


However, if you delay further, you might need to file an application for condonation of delay, which can be a bit more complicated. So, it's best to file a complaint as soon as possible to avoid any further complications.


Please let me know if you're ready to proceed with filing a complaint or if you have any further questions.
Human: okay thank you
AI: You're welcome. Remember to file a complaint as soon as possible to ensure that you're within the 2-year time frame. If you need any further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask.


Additionally, you can also reach out to the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process and provide more information on how to proceed with your complaint.

Human: Hi, I bought a set of books from amazon. After receiving them, I noticed that they were not an original copy. i want refund and compensation. what should i do 


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To help you with this issue, can you please tell me what led to this problem? Was it because the books were described as original on the Amazon website, or was there any other reason you expected them to be original?


Human: i bought the books and paid full price, i expected them to be original copies. but they turned out to be printed cheaply and held together by subpar tape 


AI: It seems like the product did not match the description on the website, which is one of the grounds for complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. 


To proceed, can you please tell me when did you receive the books and when did you notice the issue? This will help me guide you on the next steps to take.


Human: on 15th october 2024


AI: Since you received the books on October 15, 2024, you have a good amount of time to take action. The statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. So, you're well within the time frame.


Can you please tell me the name of the seller on Amazon, or the order number or the name of the book, so I can help you with drafting a formal notice to the seller? This will be the first step in resolving your issue.


Human: i have already sent a notice and did not get a response back 


AI: Not receiving a response from the seller after sending a notice is a common issue many consumers face.


Since you've already sent a notice, let's discuss the next steps. You can consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can guide you on how to proceed and provide further support.


Additionally, if you'd like, I can help you draft a follow-up notice or a complaint to be filed with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC).


Is there anything else you'd like help with, or would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline?


Human: which forum, dcdrc or scdrc 


AI: Since you are a consumer who has a complaint against an online seller, you can file a complaint with the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) in the state where you reside. The SCDRC has jurisdiction over cases involving e-commerce transactions.


However, if you're not satisfied with the response from the SCDRC, you can appeal to the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in New Delhi.


Before we proceed, I'd like to offer to help you draft a complaint to be filed with the SCDRC. This will include the details of the incident, the seller's response (or lack thereof), and the relief you're seeking.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting the complaint, or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline first?


Human: should i file with dcdrc 


AI: Since the value of the goods (books) does not exceed one crore rupees, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (DCDRF) in the district where you reside.


The DCDRF has jurisdiction over cases involving consumer disputes with a value not exceeding one crore rupees. This would be the most appropriate forum for your case.


I can help you draft a complaint to be filed with the DCDRF. This will include the details of the incident, the seller's response (or lack thereof), and the relief you're seeking.


Before we proceed, I'd like to remind you to submit three copies of the complaint: one for the DCDRF, one for the seller, and one for your own records.


Also, please note that you may need to attach an affidavit signed and verified by you to the complaint.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting the complaint?"

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the furniture? Was it a manufacturing defect or was there any other reason?


Human: a manufacturing defect 


AI: So, the issue with the furniture seems to be due to a manufacturing defect.


When did this incident happen? Please provide the date or approximate date when you received the defective furniture. This information will help us determine if the complaint can be filed within the statutory time limit of 2 years.


Human: it happened on 1st october 2024 


AI: Since the incident happened on October 1, 2024, it's within the 2-year time frame. However, I would like to note that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, came into effect on July 20, 2020. If the incident had occurred before that date, there might be some additional considerations.


Can you please provide me with the name and contact details of the e-commerce company where you purchased the furniture from? This information will help us in drafting the complaint and sending it to the correct authority.


Human: amazon 


AI: The e-commerce company involved is Amazon. Now, I'd like to know what you would like as a desired relief from Amazon. You've already mentioned that you want a refund of Rs. 20,000 and compensation for mental agony of Rs. 1 crore. Is there anything else you'd like Amazon to do, such as replacing the product or providing a discount on your next purchase?


Human: no 


AI: You would like Amazon to provide a refund of Rs. 20,000 and compensation for mental agony of Rs. 1 crore.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, the total relief sought must be within an amount of Rs. 20 lakhs. Since your desired relief exceeds this limit, we may need to consider alternative options.


Before we proceed, I'd like to inform you that you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance. If you'd like, I can also provide you with a location-based helpline number.


Would you like me to draft a legal notice to Amazon, or would you like to explore other options?


Human: i have already sent a notice to amazon and have not received a response back. i want to file a consumer complaint 


AI: Since you've already sent a notice to Amazon and haven't received a response, the next step would be to file a consumer complaint.


I can guide you through the process and help you draft a complaint. To do this, we'll need to prepare a complaint in writing, which includes the details of the incident, the relief sought, and other necessary information.


Please note that you can file the complaint in person, through an agent, or by registered post along with the required court fee. You can also file it online through the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/.


Before we proceed, I'd like to confirm that you have all the necessary documents ready, such as proof of purchase, photos of the damaged furniture, and any other relevant evidence.


Would you like me to assist you in drafting the complaint, or would you like to proceed with filing it on your own?


Human: yes, assist 


AI: To draft the complaint, I'll need some more information from you. Please provide me with the following details:


1. Your name and contact information (address, phone number, and email ID)
2. Amazon's name and address (you can provide their registered office address)
3. A brief description of the incident, including the date and time when you received the damaged furniture
4. A detailed description of the damages and the relief you're seeking (refund of Rs. 20,000 and compensation for mental agony of Rs. 1 crore)


Please provide me with this information, and I'll help you draft a complaint that you can use to file with the consumer forum.


Also, as a heads-up, you'll need to attach an affidavit signed and verified by you to the complaint. I can provide you with a sample affidavit if you'd like.

Human: I am seeking legal advice regarding a situation involving NoBroker, which appears to be posting fake negative reviews about my company, Elvin Packers and Movers, on their forum. These reviews are damaging our reputation and misleading potential customers. I would like to discuss possible legal actions we can take to address this issue and protect our brand from further harm.


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with this consumer grievance.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue with NoBroker posting fake negative reviews about your company, Elvin Packers and Movers? Was it a dispute over a transaction, a misunderstanding, or something else?


Human: nothing that I know of. It is a site where people can make posting for selling or putting their porerty on rent so buyers or tenants can find the relevant posting. they also have a listing for moving services, where people can find services like mine. under those services, people can leave comments. Some people have left really nasty comments about our moving services which are all false and nobroker approved them and refuse to take those reviews down.


AI: It seems like NoBroker's platform allows users to leave reviews and comments about various services, including moving services like yours. And in this case, some users have posted false and damaging reviews about your company, Elvin Packers and Movers, which have been approved by NoBroker.


Can you please tell me when you first noticed these fake reviews on NoBroker's platform? Was it recently, or did you notice it earlier? (Also, please note that the Consumer Protection Act has a 2-year statute of limitations, so if the incident is more than 2 years old, we might need to consider that in our next steps.)


Human: i noticed 2 months ago


AI: You noticed the fake reviews about 2 months ago. That's well within the 2-year statute of limitations, so we can proceed with exploring possible actions.


Can you please provide me with some information about NoBroker? For example, do you know their registered address, contact number, or email address? This information will be helpful in case we need to send a notice or file a complaint.


Human: their site is nobroker.com. and their customer care information is on their website. do you want me to find it?


AI: You're right, the website is nobroker.com, and they likely have their customer care information available on their website. I don't have that information readily available, and I wouldn't want to provide any incorrect details.


Instead, you can find the contact information on their website and share it with me. That way, we can use the correct contact details to proceed with the next steps.


Also, I'd like to know what kind of relief you're seeking from NoBroker. Are you looking for them to remove the fake reviews, provide a public apology, or something else?


Human: both. 


AI: You would like NoBroker to remove the fake reviews and provide a public apology for allowing such reviews to be posted on their platform.


Before we proceed with any legal action, let's try to resolve this through a soft remedy. Have you considered sending a formal notice to NoBroker, detailing the fake reviews and requesting them to remove them and issue a public apology? This can be a first step in resolving the issue amicably.


If you'd like, I can help you draft a sample notice that you can use as a template. Would you like me to do that?


Human: I sent them 3 emails regarding this.


AI: You've already sent NoBroker three emails regarding the fake reviews, but unfortunately, they haven't taken any action to remove them or issue a public apology.


In that case, we may need to consider filing a formal complaint against NoBroker. Before we proceed, I'd like to offer you a draft of a legal notice that you can use as a starting point. This notice will detail the fake reviews, request their removal, and ask for a public apology.


Would you like me to provide you with a sample draft of the legal notice?

Subject: Removal of Defamatory Reviews and Public Apology


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Defamatory Reviews on NoBroker's Platform


We are writing to bring to your attention a serious issue regarding defamatory reviews posted on NoBroker's platform regarding our company, Elvin Packers and Movers. Despite our repeated requests, these reviews remain active on your platform, causing irreparable harm to our reputation.


The reviews in question are:


[List the specific reviews that are fake and damaging]


We have reason to believe that these reviews are false and have been posted by individuals who have a vested interest in damaging our reputation. We have not been able to identify the individuals who posted these reviews, and we request that you take immediate action to remove them from your platform.


We also request that you issue a public apology for allowing these reviews to be posted on your platform. We believe that this is a necessary step to restore our reputation and prevent similar incidents in the future.


We request that you take the following actions:


1. Remove the defamatory reviews from your platform immediately.
2. Issue a public apology on your website and social media channels for allowing these reviews to be posted.
3. Take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future, including verifying the authenticity of reviews before posting them.


If we do not receive a satisfactory response from you within 14 days from the date of this notice, we will be forced to take further action to protect our rights.


Please confirm receipt of this notice and indicate the steps you will take to address our concerns.


Yours faithfully,

Please note that this is just a sample draft, and you should modify it to suit your specific needs and circumstances. You may also want to consult with a lawyer before sending the notice.


Before we proceed, is there anything else you'd like to add or change in the notice?


Human: no


AI: You're all set with the draft notice. Before you send it to NoBroker, I'd like to remind you that you can also reach out to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.


Additionally, if you need help with filing a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) or the Securities and Exchange Board of India's SCORES platform, I can guide you through the process.


Is there anything else you'd like help with or any other questions you have?


Human: why do I file a complaint to sebi?


AI: You're right, SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is not directly related to your issue with NoBroker. SEBI is primarily responsible for regulating the securities market in India, and their SCORES platform is for registering complaints related to securities market issues, such as unauthorized investments, unlisted companies, or other securities-related grievances.


In your case, the issue is with NoBroker's platform and their alleged failure to remove fake reviews. You may want to consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SDRC), which are the consumer courts in India that deal with consumer grievances.


However, if you're looking for a more general guidance on how to proceed with your complaint, I can certainly provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App. Would you like me to guide you through that process?"

Human: I bought a new car which started making clanking sound after shutting off the engine. I asked the service center for fixing the sound the service center could not fix it and told me that it is an operational issue without specifying the cause of the noise or being able to fix it. I asked them to fix the issue or replace the car or upgrade the car to which they said that they cannot do it. The cost of the car is about 55 Lakhs and is under warranty, Can I challenge company in consumer forum


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue with the car making a clanking sound after shutting off the engine? Was there any incident or event that caused this problem, or did it start suddenly?


Human: it started a month after I got the car. No specific incident happened.


AI: It seems like the issue started a month after you purchased the car, without any specific incident. This is an important detail.


Since the car is under warranty and the issue started within a month of purchase, it's possible that the problem could be related to a manufacturing defect or a quality control issue. The fact that the service center couldn't fix it and said it's an ""operational issue"" without specifying the cause, raises some concerns.


Can you please tell me when this issue started (approximate date) and when you approached the service center about it? Also, have you received any communication from the manufacturer or the dealership regarding this issue?


Human: the issue started in March of 2022. I approached service center in March 2022, May 2022 and September 2022. I had mailed the manufacturer in November 2022 but they deny any manufacturing defect. they say I have caused the issue.


AI: It seems like you've been trying to get the issue resolved for a while now.


Since the issue started in March 2022 and you've already approached the service center multiple times, it's essential to note that you've only recently been informed that the manufacturer denies any manufacturing defect and instead blames you for causing the issue.


This is a critical point, as it may impact your case in the consumer forum. The fact that the manufacturer is denying any liability and blaming you for the issue may require you to gather more evidence to prove that the problem is indeed a manufacturing defect.


As you mentioned, the car is worth around 55 lakhs and is still under warranty. Considering the time frame and the manufacturer's response, it's possible that you may have a strong case to take to the consumer forum.


Before we proceed, I want to remind you that the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since the issue started in March 2022, you have some time left to file a complaint. However, it's always better to act promptly to ensure that your case is heard in a timely manner.


Would you like to proceed with drafting a legal notice to the manufacturer, or would you like to explore other options first?


Human: what are the other options


AI: Considering your situation, you have a few options to address the issue:


1.  **Drafting a Legal Notice**: We can draft a legal notice to the manufacturer, stating the issue, the efforts you've made to resolve it, and the desired remedy. This notice will serve as a formal warning to the manufacturer to take necessary action to rectify the issue.
2.  **Filing a Consumer Complaint**: If the manufacturer doesn't respond to the legal notice or doesn't take adequate action, you can file a consumer complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC), depending on the jurisdiction.
3.  **Approaching the National Consumer Helpline**: You can contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for guidance and assistance in resolving the issue. They may be able to mediate a resolution or provide further guidance on the next steps.
4.  **Seeking Redressal through the Company's Internal Mechanism**: If the manufacturer has an internal grievance redressal mechanism, you can try to escalate the issue through that channel.


Considering the time frame and the manufacturer's response, drafting a legal notice might be a good starting point. This will help you formally notify the manufacturer of the issue and give them an opportunity to respond and rectify the situation.


Would you like to proceed with drafting a legal notice?


Human: yes


AI: To draft a legal notice, we'll need to include some essential details. Please provide me with the following information:


1.  The name and address of the manufacturer (you mentioned earlier that you mailed them in November 2022, so you should have their address)
2.  The name and address of the service center you've been dealing with
3.  A detailed description of the issue with the car (the clanking sound after shutting off the engine)
4.  The dates of the incidents when you approached the service center (March 2022, May 2022, and September 2022)
5.  The manufacturer's response to your complaint (they denied any manufacturing defect and blamed you for causing the issue)
6.  The relief you're seeking (repair, replacement, or upgrade of the car)

Subject: Defective Vehicle - Demand for Replacement/Repair


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Defective Vehicle - [Your Vehicle Number]


This is to bring to your notice that the vehicle mentioned above, which was purchased by me on [Date of Purchase] from your authorized dealership, has been experiencing a persistent issue of clanking sound after shutting off the engine. Despite multiple attempts to rectify the issue at your service center in [City], the problem persists.


The details of the incidents are as follows:


*   Date of first visit to the service center:  [Date - March 2022]
*   Date of second visit to the service center: [Date - May 2022]
*   Date of third visit to the service center: [Date - September 2022]


On each occasion, the service center staff informed me that the issue was an ""operational problem"" and not a manufacturing defect. However, I have been informed by your company that the issue is not a manufacturing defect and that I am responsible for causing it.


However, I strongly dispute this assertion and believe that the issue is a result of a manufacturing defect or a quality control issue. As the vehicle is still under warranty, I request you to take immediate action to rectify the issue.


I hereby demand that you replace the vehicle with a new one or repair the existing vehicle at your cost. If not, I will be forced to seek redressal through the consumer forum.


You are hereby given 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice to respond to this complaint and take necessary action. Failure to do so will be considered as an admission of liability on your part.


Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and confirm your intention to rectify the issue.


Yours faithfully,

Human: alright, thanks


AI: You're welcome.  If you need any further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask.


As a next step, I would recommend sending the notice to Honda Cars and waiting for their response.

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To help you better, could you please tell me what led to the issue with the photos taken by the photographer? Was there any specific agreement or contract in place regarding the quality of photos or any other issues that you're facing?


Human: no but is it not expected? it was my wedding


AI: While it's expected that a photographer would deliver good quality photos, especially for a special occasion like a wedding, the Consumer Protection Act doesn't necessarily cover issues with the quality of services if they were not specifically agreed upon in a contract.


However, if you paid for the photography services, you can consider filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. But, it would be more of a service deficiency complaint rather than a product liability case.


Could you please tell me the date when you paid for the photography services and when you received the photos?


Human: who said it was a product liability case? 


AI: You're right, it's a service deficiency case. My apologies for the confusion.


To proceed, could you please tell me the date when you paid for the photography services and when you received the photos? This will help me understand the timeline of the issue.


Human: the wedding was in february 2024. I received pictures in April 2024.


AI: Since the wedding was in February 2024 and you received the photos in April 2024, your complaint is well within the 2-year time limit for filing a consumer complaint under the Consumer Protection Act.


Can you please tell me the name and contact details of the photographer, as well as the amount you paid for the photography services? This information will be helpful in drafting a complaint.

Human: i really needed ketamine for very valid health reasons, but the pharmacy at my local hospital refused to give it to me without stating any reasons. how do i sue them?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to the pharmacy's refusal to provide the ketamine to you? Was it due to a lack of stock, a policy issue, or something else?


Human: they said they can't give it to me without a prescription 


AI: The pharmacy's refusal to provide the ketamine without a prescription seems reasonable, as it's a controlled substance and requires a medical professional's authorization.


However, I'd like to clarify that this incident occurred when? Was it recently or a while ago? This is important because there's a time limit of 2 years to file a consumer complaint in India.


Human: it happened yesterday 


AI: Since the incident occurred recently, you still have time to take action.


Given that the pharmacy refused to provide the ketamine without a prescription, it's likely that they followed the standard medical protocol. However, I'd like to know more about the opposing party (the pharmacy) in this case. Can you please provide me with the name and contact information of the pharmacy, if you have it?

Human: i want compensation 


AI: You're seeking compensation for the inconvenience caused by the pharmacy's refusal to provide the ketamine without a prescription.


Considering your desired relief is compensation, I'd recommend that you first approach the pharmacy's customer care department to register a formal complaint. If you're not satisfied with their response, you can escalate the issue to the State Medical Council (SMC) or the Medical Council of India (MCI).


Here's a brief overview of the steps you can take:


1. Approach the pharmacy's customer care department to register a complaint.
2. If not satisfied, approach the State Medical Council (SMC) in your area.
3. If not satisfied with the SMC's response, approach the Medical Council of India (MCI).

Subject: Complaint for Refusal to Provide Ketamine without Prescription


Dear Sir/Madam,


I am writing to express my disappointment and concern regarding the service I received at your pharmacy located at Nagarbhavi. On [date], I visited your pharmacy to purchase ketamine, a medication that I require for my medical condition. However, the pharmacist at your store refused to provide me with the medication without a prescription.


I understand that ketamine is a controlled substance and requires a medical professional's authorization. However, I was not provided with any clear explanation or alternative solutions for obtaining the medication. I believe that your pharmacy should have provided me with a clear reason for the refusal or offered assistance in obtaining a prescription.


I request that you take immediate action to address this incident and provide a suitable solution. I would like to request compensation for the inconvenience and distress caused by your pharmacy's actions.


I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently and take necessary steps to prevent such incidents in the future.


Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and inform me of the actions you will take to resolve this matter.


Yours sincerely,

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I purchased a packaged food from a mall. However later I had food poisoning. When I saw the packet, it mentioned presence of an ingredient to which I am allergic but it was so small that nobody would see it. Can I file a consumer complaint?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. That sounds like a serious issue. To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the packaged food? Was it the packaging, the ingredient labeling, or something else that caused the problem?


Human: I already mentioned that


AI: You mentioned that the packaged food had a small print of an ingredient to which you are allergic. That's a concern for inadequate labelling for allergens. 


Can you please tell me when you purchased the product and when you consumed it, as well as when you experienced the food poisoning symptoms? This will help me understand the timeline of the incident.


Human: I consumed it before expiry


AI: Since you consumed the product before its expiry, the issue is not related to the product being expired. 


As per the Consumer Protection Act, there is a time limit to file a complaint, which is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since today's date is 2024-10-08, you have filed your complaint within the time limit.


Given the issue with inadequate labelling for allergens, you may have a strong case. Can you please provide more information about the product, such as the brand name, and the store where you purchased it? This will help me better understand your situation.


Human: Can the store also be held liable or only the manufacturer?


AI: In cases of inadequate labelling for allergens, both the manufacturer and the retailer can be held liable. As the retailer, the store where you purchased the product has a responsibility to ensure that the products they sell are properly labelled and safe for consumption.


However, in many cases, the manufacturer is ultimately responsible for ensuring that their products are properly labelled. The retailer may also be held responsible if they failed to follow proper procedures in displaying and storing the product.


To proceed with a complaint, you may want to consider sending a legal notice to both the manufacturer and the retailer. I can help you draft a sample legal notice if you'd like. Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice?


Human: If I had purchased it online, would I still have any remedy?


AI: If you had purchased the packaged food online, you would still have a remedy under the Consumer Protection Act. As an e-commerce consumer, you have the right to seek redressal for any deficiency in the product or service, including inadequate labelling for allergens.


In this case, you would likely file a complaint with the e-commerce company, and if they fail to resolve the issue, you can approach the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.


I can guide you on the process of filing a complaint with the e-commerce company and drafting a complaint petition if needed. Would you like me to provide more information on this process?


Human: Actually I am blind


AI: As a blind consumer, you may face additional challenges in accessing information about products, including packaging and labelling. This highlights the importance of accessible and clear labelling for all consumers, including those with disabilities.


In this case, the retailer and the manufacturer may be held liable not only for the inadequate labelling but also for failing to provide accessible information to consumers with disabilities.


You can file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or use the UMANG App for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process of filing a complaint and provide support in accessing the necessary information.


Additionally, you may want to consider contacting the Disability Rights Federation of India or other organizations that support consumers with disabilities for guidance and assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your complaint or accessing consumer rights as a blind consumer?

78,"i asked it for a notice, and just to confuse it said this - i want an apology and an assurance that the data won't be used against me. can i drag them to court right now actually?

it immediately stopped drafting the notice, and proceeded to draft a complaint. it gets thrown off the general flow pretty easily. then it told me to ""amicably resolve the issue"", but then suggested NCH and e-dhaakil. I do not think it understands what either does.

after drafting the complaint, it asks me if i want to approach the service provider instead.

does not give me the option to file a complaint in person at all until specifically asked. 

also, directed me to SCDRC automatically, without considering monetary value/any other information ""However, before we proceed with drafting a legal notice or filing a complaint, I would recommend trying to resolve the issue amicably through the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) or the e-daakhil portal.""

i don't think the bot understands what the NCH or portal does

""You can also visit the official website of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDC) at http://ncdrc.nic.in/ to find the list of offices and their contact details.""


incorrect, NCDRC does not have branches. the website does not list offices of the SCDRC or DCDRF either. also, says NCDC instead of NCDRC.

Human: I got a package of~3k from Ajio via Delhivery via COD. I got the package after payment but had to return the product due to sizing issue. Turns out, the delivery agent ran away with the payment and that's why it showed that it was undelivered for weeks. Eventually, Ajio took back the product & refunded me. Now Delhivery made me sign on a document about the ""loss"" & recorded a call making me say I received it (I mentioned both times I paid for it too). What do I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with this issue.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the delivery agent running away with the payment and recording a false document from you? Was it a one-time incident or a recurring problem with Delhivery's delivery agents?


Human: i don't know it just happened


AI: It can be a frustrating experience.


Can you please tell me when this incident happened? Was it recently or some time ago? This will help me understand the timeline and advise you on the next steps to take.


Human: yesterday 


AI: Since the incident happened recently, you're still within the time frame to take action.


Can you please tell me more about Delhivery and Ajio's roles in this issue? Are they the same company, or are they separate entities involved in the delivery and sale of the product?


Human: Delhivery is the delivery service, ajio is the website i ordered clothes from


AI: So, Delhivery is the courier service provider, and Ajio is the e-commerce website from which you ordered the clothes.


Since you've already received a refund from Ajio, your main concern now is with Delhivery regarding the false documentation and recording of a call. You may want to consider taking further action against Delhivery for this.


Would you like to explore the option of sending a legal notice to Delhivery, or would you like to try to resolve this issue through other means?


Human: yes


AI: Sending a legal notice to Delhivery can be a good step in getting them to rectify the situation and acknowledge their mistake.

Human: i want an apology and an assurance that the data won't be used against me. can i drag them to court right now actually?


AI: You're seeking a formal apology and a guarantee that Delhivery will not use the recorded call or document against you in the future.


Regarding taking Delhivery to court, the statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint in India is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since you mentioned the incident happened yesterday, you're well within the time frame to file a complaint.


However, before we proceed with drafting a legal notice or filing a complaint, I would recommend trying to resolve the issue amicably through the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) or the e-daakhil portal. This can save you time and effort in the long run.

You can file a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. If you'd like, I can provide you with more information on how to use these resources.


Do you have any questions or would you like me to help with anything else?


Human: Where to file this complaint?


AI: You can file a complaint against the retailer of the contraceptive at the following places:


1. **District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF)**: You can file a complaint at the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum in the district where you purchased the product or where you reside.
2. **State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC)**: You can also file a complaint at the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission in your state.
3. **National Consumer Helpline (NCH)**: You can file a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App.
4. **e-daakhil portal**: You can also file a complaint online at the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/.


To file a complaint, you will need to provide the following documents:


* A written complaint
* Proof of purchase (invoice, receipt, etc.)
* Proof of payment (bank statement, etc.)
* Any other relevant documents


Please note that you can also file a complaint through a consumer protection organization or a consumer rights activist.


Additionally, you can also try to resolve the issue through:


* Direct negotiation with the retailer
* Mediation
* Arbitration


It's always a good idea to consult with a consumer rights activist or a lawyer before filing a complaint to understand your rights and the process.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint at any of these places?


Human: If the value of the contraceptive is Rs. 40 lakh but the additional compensation I want for Rs. 12 lakh- then where to file?


AI: Since the value of the contraceptive is Rs. 40 lakh and you are seeking an additional compensation of Rs. 12 lakh, the total amount in dispute is Rs. 52 lakh.


According to the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) has jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services is up to Rs. 1 crore.


However, in your case, the total amount in dispute exceeds Rs. 1 crore. Therefore, you can file a complaint at the **State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC)** or the **National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC)**.


The NCDRC has jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services is more than Rs. 1 crore, and it is the highest consumer court in the country.


You can file a complaint at the SCDRC or NCDRC, depending on your preference. However, I would recommend filing a complaint at the NCDRC, as it is the highest consumer court in the country and has the power to pass orders that are binding on the parties.


To file a complaint at the NCDRC, you will need to provide the following documents:


* A written complaint
* Proof of purchase (invoice, receipt, etc.)

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I had won a competition. They said they would send me the trophy by courier. I never received the trophy even after stating the correct address. What to do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you with this issue.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with not receiving the trophy? Was there any communication from the organizers regarding the delay or any issues with the shipping?


Human: I don't know


AI: It's possible that the organizers might not have communicated the issue with you. Can you please tell me when did you last hear from them or when did you expect to receive the trophy? Also, please note that the statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India is 2 years, so if it's been more than 2 years since you were supposed to receive the trophy, we might need to consider that in our next steps.


Human: I last received a mail on 21/3/2023


AI: You last heard from the organizers on March 21, 2023. That's within the 2-year time frame.


To proceed, can you please provide me with the details of the organizers, such as their name, contact number, or any other relevant information? This will help me guide you further on the next steps to take.


Human: I had contacted the courier services. They are telling they do not have it and it had already been dispatched


AI: It seems like the courier service is denying any responsibility in this matter. In that case, we may need to escalate the issue to the organizers of the competition.


Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from the organizers? Are you looking to get the trophy delivered, a refund, or something else?


Human: Yes trophy delivered


AI: You would like to receive the trophy that was supposed to be delivered to you.


Before we proceed, I would like to inform you that as a consumer, you have the right to approach the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance. You can also check the website of the Competition Authority in your state to see if they have any guidelines or procedures for resolving disputes related to competitions.


In terms of drafting a legal notice to the organizers, I can help you with that. A legal notice is a formal communication that requires the organizers to take action to resolve the issue. Would you like me to provide you with a draft legal notice that you can use as a starting point?


Also, are there any other issues or concerns you would like to discuss regarding this matter?


Human: The organiser was a company. No more in existence


AI: Since the organizer is no longer in existence, it might be more challenging to pursue the matter further.


In this case, I would recommend sending a notice to the company's registered office or the person responsible for the competition, if possible. However, if the company is no longer operational, you may need to consider alternative options.


Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that you can still contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for assistance. They may be able to provide you with guidance on how to proceed or suggest alternative options.


Additionally, you can also try contacting the local consumer court or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in your area for further assistance.


Would you like me to provide you with a draft notice that you can use as a starting point, or would you like to explore other options?


Human: What other options?


AI: Since the company is no longer in existence, some options might be limited. However, here are a few alternatives:


1. **File a complaint with the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC)**: You can file a complaint with the SDRC in your state, providing them with all the necessary documents and evidence. They may be able to provide you with a resolution or compensation.
2. **Contact the Competition Commission of India (CCI)**: If the competition was a major one, you can file a complaint with the CCI, which is responsible for regulating and enforcing competition laws in India.
3. **File a police complaint**: If you suspect any fraud or cheating by the company, you can file a police complaint. However, this might not be the most effective option in this case.
4. **Seek assistance from a consumer rights organization**: There are many consumer rights organizations in India that can provide you with guidance and assistance in resolving your issue.


These options may not guarantee a resolution, but they can help you explore other avenues for seeking justice.


Would you like me to provide you with a draft notice or help you with any of these options?


Human: Can I file a complaint against the courier service when I did not purchase its service?


AI: You're wondering if you can file a complaint against the courier service even though you didn't purchase their service directly.


In this case, the courier service might argue that they are not liable for the loss of the trophy, as it was not a direct transaction between you and the courier service.


However, if the courier service had a contract or agreement with the organizer to deliver the trophy, and they failed to do so, you might still have a case against them.


But since you didn't purchase the courier service directly, it might be a bit more challenging to file a complaint.


Let's focus on getting the trophy from the organizer first. We can try to draft a notice to the organizer's registered office (if available) or the person responsible for the competition.


Would you like me to provide you with a draft notice for the organizer?


Human: Am I a consumer of the courier service?


AI: You are not a consumer of the courier service in the classical sense, as you did not purchase their service directly. The courier service was engaged by the organizer to deliver the trophy to you.


In that case, you might not be able to file a complaint against the courier service under consumer protection laws, as you are not a direct consumer of their service.


Let's focus on exploring other options for getting the trophy from the organizer. Would you like me to provide you with a draft notice for the organizer?


Human: Yes

Would you like me to provide you with more information on how to file a complaint through these channels?

AI: Since the incident occurred in Bangalore and you were dropped off in Kochi, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in either Bangalore or Kochi, depending on which one has jurisdiction over the incident.


If the value of the dispute is less than Rs. 1 crore, you can file a complaint with the District Commission in Bangalore. However, if the value exceeds Rs. 1 crore, you may need to file a complaint with the State Commission.


You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for assistance in determining the correct jurisdiction and filing the complaint.

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I understand that you enrolled in a college in 2021, deposited 70% of the fees, and had to leave due to health issues and COVID-19 lockdown. Now, the college is asking for the remaining fees in exchange for your documents.

However, considering your circumstances, you may want to explore other options.


Before we proceed, I would like to warn you that since you enrolled in 2021, the incident is slightly over 2 years old.

AI: It sounds like you're seeking a refund for the unused portion of the fees and the return of your original documents. Given your situation, you may have a valid claim under the Consumer Protection Act.


Considering your college is not being cooperative, I can guide you on drafting a legal notice to them. A legal notice is a formal document that puts the college on notice of your grievances and demands a resolution.

Human: I purchased tickets for a concert months in advance, but the event got postponed multiple times due to reasons beyond my control. Now, I want a refund, but the event organizer is refusing, stating that the event is merely postponed and not canceled.


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd be happy to help you with this issue. 


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to the event being postponed multiple times? Was it due to reasons like artist unavailability, venue change, or something else?


Human: artist unavailability


AI: Artist unavailability is a common reason for event postponements.


Can you please tell me when the last postponement occurred? Was it recently, or was it some time ago? Also, please note that the statute of limitations for consumer complaints in India is 2 years. If the incident is more than 2 years old, you may not be able to file a complaint now.


Human: october 15


AI: Since the incident occurred in October, it's likely that the statute of limitations hasn't expired yet, given the current year is 2024.


Can you please tell me about the event organizer? What is the name of the company or individual that you booked the tickets from?


Human: BookMyShow 


AI: BookMyShow is a well-known ticketing platform in India.


Have you received any communication from BookMyShow regarding the refund or rescheduling of the event? If so, can you please tell me about the response they provided? Did they offer any refund, compensation, or alternative dates?


Human: this is what their emial said: Dear [Customer Name],  We’ve received your request for a refund regarding the [Event Name] booking. However, please note that as per our policy, we are not issuing refunds because the event has been postponed, not canceled. Your tickets remain valid for the new date, which will be communicated to you shortly.  We understand that you may be disappointed by the delay, but multiple postponements do not entitle you to a refund. By purchasing the tickets, you agreed to the terms and conditions, which clearly state that refunds are only applicable in the event of a full cancellation.  We suggest you hold onto your tickets for the new date, as there is no further action we can take regarding this matter. If you cannot attend on the revised date, it is your responsibility to make alternate arrangements.  Thank you for understanding.


AI: It seems that BookMyShow is standing by their policy, stating that since the event is not canceled, they are not issuing a refund.


Considering this, it seems like you're not looking for a refund, but rather a cancellation of the ticket or a refund due to the multiple postponements. In this case, you may want to consider sending a polite email to BookMyShow, reiterating your request and explaining your situation. You can also mention that the multiple postponements have caused inconvenience and financial loss to you.


If you're not satisfied with their response, you can consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for assistance. Additionally, you can also approach the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (CDRC) or the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) for further action.


Would you like me to help you draft a polite email to BookMyShow, or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint?

Subject: Request for Refund due to Multiple Postponements


Dear BookMyShow Team,


I am writing to reiterate my request for a refund for the [Event Name] booking that I made through your platform. As you are aware, the event has been postponed multiple times, and I have been holding onto my tickets for the new dates. However, I am still not satisfied with the situation and would like to request a refund due to the inconvenience and financial loss caused by the repeated postponements.


As per your email dated [Date], you mentioned that refunds are only applicable in the event of a full cancellation, and since the event is not canceled, I am not entitled to a refund. However, I would like to bring to your attention that multiple postponements have caused significant disruption to my plans, and I believe it is reasonable to expect a refund or some form of compensation in this case.


I would appreciate it if you could reconsider my request and provide a refund or offer an alternative solution. If not, I will be forced to explore other options, including filing a complaint with the relevant consumer forums.


Please let me know if there's any further information you need from me to process my request.


Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.


Sincerely,

2. Send a follow-up email to BookMyShow, reiterating your request and expressing your disappointment that they haven't responded.
3. If they still don't respond, you can escalate the matter to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App.

Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline or the consumer forums?


Human: yes please

1. Your name and contact details
2. BookMyShow's name and contact details
3. The event details (name, date, and location)
4. A clear description of the issue (multiple postponements and your request for a refund or cancellation)

Would you like me to help you draft a complaint to be submitted to the NCH or the consumer forums?


Human: where would i file this complaint? 


AI: Since you booked the ticket through BookMyShow, which is an online ticketing platform, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (CDRC) in your state.


However, considering BookMyShow is an e-commerce company, you may also want to file a complaint with the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which has jurisdiction over e-commerce companies.


To determine which consumer forum to approach, you can use the following guidelines:


1. If the transaction value is up to Rs. 1 lakh, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in your state.
2. If the transaction value is between Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 10 lakhs, you can file a complaint with the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (CDRC) in your state.
3. If the transaction value is above Rs. 10 lakhs, you can file a complaint with the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC).


Since the transaction value in your case is not specified, I would recommend filing a complaint with the CDRC in your state, as it has jurisdiction over e-commerce companies like BookMyShow.


To find the CDRC in your state, you can visit the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Government of India's website: [www.consumeraffairs.gov.in](http://www.consumeraffairs.gov.in). You can search for the CDRC in your state and file a complaint online or in person.

Can I file a case against them at District consumer forum? If I can, on what grounds after Supreme Court judgment?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with this issue.


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue with the restaurant charging you more than the MRP for the Bisleri bottle? Was it a one-time incident or a recurring issue?


Human: one time incident


AI: Since it's a one-time incident, let's proceed with gathering more information.


Can you please tell me the date of this incident? Also, please note that the Consumer Protection Act has a time limit of 2 years for filing a complaint, so if the incident is more than 2 years old, you might not be eligible to file a case.

AI: The incident occurred in September 2024, which is within the 2-year time limit.


You mentioned that the restaurant management cited a Supreme Court judgment from February this year as the reason for charging you more than the MRP. Can you please provide more details about this judgment, such as the case number or a brief summary of the judgment? This will help me understand the context and provide you with more accurate guidance.


Human: I dont know anything about the judgement


AI: It's possible that the restaurant management might have mentioned a judgment, but it's not relevant to your case.


In India, the Consumer Protection Act prohibits charging more than the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of a product. Charging more than the MRP is considered a unfair trade practice, which is punishable under the Act.


Considering this, you can file a complaint against the restaurant at the District Consumer Forum, alleging unfair trade practice. The grounds for your complaint would be that the restaurant charged you more than the MRP of the Bisleri bottle, which is against the Consumer Protection Act.

Background:


On [Date of Incident], I visited [Restaurant Name] at [Restaurant Address] and was charged Rs. 60 for a Bisleri bottle, which is priced at Rs. 20. This is a clear case of unfair trade practice, as the Opposite Party has charged me more than the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the product.


Previous Action:


I had served a legal notice to the Opposite Party on [Date of Serving Notice] (copy attached) demanding a refund of the excess amount charged and a written undertaking not to repeat such unfair trade practice. However, the Opposite Party has failed to respond to my notice.


Relief Sought:


I pray that this Hon'ble Forum may be pleased to pass an order against the Opposite Party to:


1. Refund the excess amount of Rs. 40 paid by me for the Bisleri bottle.
2. Provide a written undertaking not to repeat such unfair trade practice in the future.

Re: Pilgrimage Tour to Saudi Arabia (April [Year])


I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the services provided by your company, GreatHoliday Travels, Kerala, for our pilgrimage tour to Saudi Arabia in April this year. Although your brochure promised us ""lavish food and stay at popular hotels"" (specifically mentioning Pearls Hotel and ANC Hotel), we were provided with substandard accommodation and normal food during our stay.


The discrepancy between the promised and actual services has caused us significant distress and financial loss. We request you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and provide us with a full refund of the tour amount, along with compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the harassment and inconvenience caused.


We request you to acknowledge receipt of this complaint and respond within 15 days with a plan of action to resolve this issue.


Yours sincerely,

To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to the issue with the jeans' fabric? Was it a manufacturing defect, or was it damaged during use or handling?


Human: the threads were loose and falling apart near the hem

When did you purchase the jeans from Pantaloons in Nagarbhavi, and did you keep the receipt or any other proof of purchase?


Human: i purchased it on 2nd october 2023 and i have proof of purchase 


AI: You purchased the jeans on October 2nd, 2023, and you have proof of purchase, which is good.


Since the incident is within the 2-year time frame, you are eligible to file a complaint. However, I would like to ask, have you already tried to contact the customer care again after your previous experience, or have you approached the store in Nagarbhavi directly to report the issue?


Human: yes, i went to the store to complaint but they made me go away and did not address the issue 


AI: It's unfortunate to hear that the store staff didn't address your issue. 


Given that the store staff has been uncooperative, it's time to consider filing a formal complaint. Before we proceed, can you please provide me with the name of the store manager or the staff member who interacted with you at the Nagarbhavi store? This information will be helpful in drafting a complaint.

Human: should i file in the dcdrc or scdrc 


AI: Based on the information you provided, the value of the goods (jeans) paid as consideration is likely to be less than one crore rupees. As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) has jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed one crore rupees.


Therefore, I would recommend filing the complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) instead of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC).


However, if you're unsure or have any doubts, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 or visit their website for further guidance.

If you need any further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: which forum should i go to 


AI: Based on the details you provided, since you are a consumer and the opposite party is a shop, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Commission.


Here are the steps to find the correct forum:


1.  Visit the website of the National Consumer Helpline at [www.nch.in](http://www.nch.in).
2.  Click on the ""Find a Forum"" tab.
3.  Enter your state and district to find the correct forum.


In your case, since you didn't mention the state, I'll provide you with a general overview of the options:


*   **District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF):** This forum deals with complaints up to ₹5 lakhs. You can file a complaint at the DCDRF in your district.
*   **State Consumer Commission:** This forum deals with complaints above ₹5 lakhs. You can file a complaint at the State Consumer Commission in your state.


Please note that the jurisdiction of the forum depends on the value of the complaint and the location of the opposite party.


If you need help finding the correct forum or have any questions, feel free to ask.

Human: should i go to district or state commission

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) deals with complaints up to ₹1 crore, while the State Consumer Commission deals with complaints above ₹1 crore.


In your case, since you're seeking a replacement, a refund, and compensation for the wrong prescription glasses, the value of the complaint is likely to be less than ₹1 crore.


Therefore, I would recommend filing a complaint at the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in your district.


You can find the contact details of the DCDRF in your district on the National Consumer Helpline website at [www.nch.in](http://www.nch.in) or by calling the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000.

Human: I upgraded my phone plan with my mobile provider to a new 'unlimited data' plan for ₹999 per month. But when I started using it, I found that after just 50GB of data, my speed dropped drastically. I called customer support, and they said the unlimited data is only for browsing and social media, and not for streaming or downloads, which was never mentioned in the advertising.


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was there anything specific that you did or any particular action taken by the customer support team that made you feel misled?


Human: the ad on their website 


AI: It seems that the advertisement on their website may have been misleading. Can you please tell me when you upgraded your phone plan and when you first noticed the issue with the data speed? This is important to know as the Consumer Protection Act in India has a time limit of 2 years for filing a complaint.


Human: yesterday


AI: You're reporting the issue just a day after it happened. That's good timing.


Can you please tell me a little more about the mobile provider you're dealing with? What is the name of the company, and do you have any information about their customer support team, such as their contact details or a reference number for the conversation you had with them?


Human: AirFone


AI: I'm assuming you meant to say ""Airtel"" or another well-known mobile provider, but since you mentioned ""AirFone"", I'll continue with the conversation.


You've already taken the first step by speaking with their customer support team. Now, let's focus on seeking a resolution.


What kind of relief are you looking for in this situation? Are you seeking a refund, a change in the plan, or something else?


Human: i want a refund 


AI: You're seeking a refund for the ""unlimited data"" plan that you feel was misrepresented. 


Before we proceed with any further action, I want to inform you that you can try to resolve this issue amicably by sending a notice to the service provider. This notice should detail the defects in the service (in this case, the misleading advertisement and the poor internet speed after 50GB of data usage).


If you'd like, I can help you draft a sample notice that you can use as a starting point.


Additionally, if you're not satisfied with the response from the service provider, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for further assistance.


Would you like me to help you draft a notice or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint directly?


Human: yes thanks !


AI: I'll help you draft a sample notice. Here's a basic template you can use as a starting point:


**Notice to Airtel**


[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[City, State, Pincode]
[Email ID]
[Phone Number]
[Date]


Airtel Customer Care
[Airtel's Address]
[City, State, Pincode]


Subject: Complaint against Misleading Advertisement and Unsatisfactory Service


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Misleading Advertisement and Unsatisfactory Service for ""Unlimited Data"" Plan


I am writing to bring to your notice a serious issue with my Airtel ""unlimited data"" plan, which I upgraded to on [Date of Upgradation]. The plan was advertised on your website as offering ""unlimited data"" for ₹999 per month, but in reality, the speed drops drastically after 50GB of data usage.


I have been a loyal customer of Airtel and have always been satisfied with their services. However, this experience has been disappointing and frustrating. I believe that the advertisement was misleading, and I was not aware of the restrictions on data usage.


I request you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and provide a suitable refund for the plan. I would appreciate it if you could also clarify the terms and conditions of the plan and ensure that such misrepresentation does not happen in the future.


Please find attached a copy of the advertisement and my plan details for your reference.


Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.


Sincerely,


[Your Name]


Please note that this is just a sample, and you should modify it according to your specific situation. Also, make sure to keep a copy of the notice for your records.


Before sending the notice, I would like to remind you that you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App for further assistance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: okay, how do i file a complaint in person? do i need to go myself?


AI: You can file a complaint in person at the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) office in your area. However, it's not necessary for you to go yourself. You can appoint an authorized representative, such as a friend or family member, or even a lawyer to represent you.


To find the nearest DCDRF or SCDRC office, you can:


1. Visit the National Consumer Helpline website (ncdrc.nic.in) and click on the ""District Commission"" tab.
2. Enter your state and district to find the contact details of the DCDRF or SCDRC office in your area.
3. Alternatively, you can search online for ""District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum [Your State]"" or ""State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission [Your State]"".


Once you find the office, you can visit them in person, along with the necessary documents and proof of your complaint. They will guide you through the process and help you file the complaint.


If you prefer to file the complaint through an agent, you can also use the services of a consumer court lawyer or a consumer rights organization in your area.


Would you like me to provide more information on the documents required to file a complaint in person?


Human: yes please 


AI: To file a complaint in person at the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) office, you will need to submit the following documents:


1. **Complaint**: A written complaint detailing the issues with the service provider, Airtel, and the relief you are seeking.
2. **Affidavit**: An affidavit sworn by you, the complainant, verifying the facts mentioned in the complaint.
3. **Proof of payment**: A copy of the receipt or invoice for the Airtel plan you purchased.
4. **Proof of identity**: A copy of your ID proof, such as a passport, driving license, or Aadhaar card.
5. **Proof of address**: A copy of your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement.


You may also need to provide additional documents, such as:


1. **Copies of communication**: Copies of emails, letters, or messages exchanged with Airtel's customer support team.
2. **Proof of purchase**: A copy of the Airtel plan's terms and conditions, or any other relevant documents related to the plan.
3. **Witness statements**: Statements from witnesses, if any, who can corroborate your claim.


It's a good idea to keep multiple copies of these documents and to submit them to the DCDRF or SCDRC office in person.


Please note that the specific documents required may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of complaint. It's always a good idea to check with the DCDRF or SCDRC office in your area for their specific requirements.


Would you like me to help you draft the complaint or affidavit?


Human: where will i file it? im from bangalore


AI: As you're from Bangalore, you can file the complaint at the Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (KSCDRC) or the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in Bangalore.

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: I purchased a question bank. Even after solving it, I did not crack IIT-JEE. I want to file a complaint against the editors of he book. What to do?


AI: I can't answer that. I can help you with consumer-related issues.


Human: The book was worthless. I want to file a consumer complaint


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To help me better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to your dissatisfaction with the question bank? Was there any false or misleading information, or did the book not meet your expectations in terms of quality or content?


Human: Did not meet my expectations


AI: It can be frustrating when a product doesn't meet our expectations.


Can you please tell me when you purchased the question bank? This will help me determine if there's a time limit for filing a complaint. (As per the Consumer Protection Act, the time limit for filing a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident.)


Human: Recently


AI: Since you mentioned it was a recent purchase, you should be within the 2-year time limit for filing a complaint.


Can you please provide me with some details about the opposing party, such as the name of the publisher or the company that produced the question bank? This will help me guide you further on the next steps.


Human: I only know the editors


AI: It can be challenging to identify the opposing party when the information is not readily available.


In this case, you can still file a complaint against the publisher or the company that sold the question bank to you. You can try to find the contact information of the publisher or the company through the book's packaging, website, or other available resources.


If you're unable to find the contact information, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App, and they can guide you further.


What kind of relief are you seeking in this matter? Do you want a refund, replacement, or some other form of compensation?


Human: Can't I file it against the editors?


AI: Under the Consumer Protection Act, a complaint can be filed against the manufacturer, service provider, or seller of a product or service. In this case, if the editors are the ones who prepared the question bank, you may be able to file a complaint against them.


However, please note that the editors might not be the ones who sold you the question bank, and they might not be directly responsible for the product's quality.


To proceed, I would need to know if the editors are employed by a specific company or organization that published the question bank. If you have any information about the publisher or the company that employed the editors, it would be helpful.


Additionally, I can help you draft a legal notice to the editors or the publisher, which is the first step in filing a consumer complaint. Would you like me to guide you through that process?


Human: No editors are not employed


AI: In that case, it's unlikely that you can file a complaint directly against the editors, as they are likely individuals who worked on the project and not the actual sellers or manufacturers of the product.


However, you can still file a complaint against the company or individual who sold you the question bank. If you're unable to find the contact information of the seller, you can consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or through the UMANG App, and they can guide you further.


If you'd like, I can help you draft a complaint against the seller, and also provide you with information on how to proceed with filing the complaint.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: The book cost me my seat at IIT JEE for which I would have earned around 65 lakhs a year. What should be the pecuniary jurisdiction


AI: I can't provide legal advice. However, I can give you some general information about pecuniary jurisdiction. Would that help?


Human: I want the specific pecuniary jurisdiction where I can file


AI: Based on the information provided, it seems that you are seeking compensation for a loss of around 65 lakhs, which is significantly higher than the upper limit for the District Commission (₹1 crore).


According to the Consumer Protection Act, if the value of the claimed compensation exceeds ₹1 crore but does not exceed ₹2 crores, the State Commission would have jurisdiction.


However, in this case, the compensation you're seeking is much higher than ₹2 crores. In such cases, the National Commission would have jurisdiction.


But since the book's cost is not the main issue here, and the main issue is the loss of a seat in IIT JEE and the potential earning of ₹65 lakhs, the pecuniary jurisdiction might not be directly applicable. You would need to calculate the pecuniary jurisdiction based on the actual loss caused by the book, which is not clearly defined. 


I would recommend consulting a legal expert to determine the correct pecuniary jurisdiction in your case.


Human: Am I a consumer?


AI: Based on the information provided, it seems that you purchased the question bank for personal use, which is a requirement for being considered a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act. Additionally, you used the book for the purpose of preparing for the IIT JEE exam, which is also a personal use.


Therefore, it appears that you are indeed a consumer.


Human: Okay. Thank you.


AI: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with filing a complaint or drafting a notice, please feel free to ask. 


Also, don't forget to reach out to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the UMANG App for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance. They can provide you with more guidance and support.

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help. 


To better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to this incident? Was there anything unusual about the product packaging, or was it a normal purchase from the shop?


Human: Normal


AI: It seems like the incident occurred without any prior warning or indication on the product packaging. 


Can you please tell me when this incident happened? This information will help me guide you further.


Human: In 2011


AI: The incident occurred in 2011. Please note that according to the Consumer Protection Act, the time limit to file a complaint is 2 years from the date of the incident. Since it has been more than 13 years, it might be challenging to pursue a legal case. However, I can still guide you on the possible steps you can take.


Can you please provide me with the name and contact details of the shop where you purchased the mixture paste? This information will help me assist you further.


Human: No I already filed a consumer complaint in 2020


AI: Since you have already filed a consumer complaint in 2020, we can proceed with that.


You suffered burns due to the explosion caused by the mixture paste, and there was no warning or information provided by the seller. You can consider pursuing a product liability action against the manufacturer or the seller.


Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you looking for? Are you seeking compensation for the damages, medical expenses, or something else?


Human: But the complaint failed to work. It was dismissed. What to do?


AI: I'm sorry to hear that your complaint was dismissed.


Considering that you've already filed a complaint and it was dismissed, we can explore other options. You can consider appealing the decision or filing a complaint with a higher consumer forum.


However, before we proceed, I would like to offer some soft remedies that might help resolve the issue amicably. Have you considered reaching out to the shop or the manufacturer to see if they can provide any compensation or assistance for the damages you suffered? Sometimes, a polite and persistent approach can lead to a resolution.


If you're not interested in pursuing a legal route, I can guide you on how to draft a complaint for a higher consumer forum or appeal the previous decision.


Human: I tried polite approach, then filed a complaint


AI: You've already tried a polite approach and filed a complaint, and it was dismissed.


In this case, we can explore other options. As per the Consumer Protection Act, you can file a complaint with the State Medical Council (SMC) since the product was a mixture paste, which is a medical product. You can also consider filing a complaint with the Medical Council of India or submitting your complaint through the National Health Portal's Grievance redressal.


Would you like me to guide you on how to file a complaint with the SMC or the Medical Council of India?


Human: My complaint was dismissed due to limitation only. Isn't there any other way to get my complaint admitted?


AI: The complaint was dismissed due to limitation, which means it was filed outside the 2-year time frame as per the Consumer Protection Act.


In this case, you can consider filing an application for condonation of delay along with your complaint. This application should be notarized and attested, and it should explain the reasons for the delay in filing the complaint.


Additionally, you can also provide supporting documents and evidence to substantiate your claim. If the District Forum is satisfied with your reasons for the delay, they may condone the delay and admit your complaint.


I can help you draft a sample application for condonation of delay. Would you like me to guide you through the process?


Human: Yes


AI: To draft an application for condonation of delay, I'll need some more information. Can you please provide me with a brief explanation of why you were unable to file the complaint within the 2-year time frame? This will help me draft a strong application.


Also, have you already drafted a complaint or a notice to the seller? If so, please share it with me, and I can help you modify it to include the application for condonation of delay.


Human: No notice. I was hospitalized for 4 years and thereafter did not have the mental ability to go for litigation.


AI: Given your situation, we can draft a strong application for condonation of delay. I'll guide you through the process.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, the District Forum may condone the delay if they're satisfied with the reasons for the delay. In your case, being hospitalized for 4 years and not having the mental ability to pursue litigation is a valid reason.


I can help you draft an application for condonation of delay, which should be notarized and attested. This application will explain the reasons for the delay and request the District Forum to condone the delay.


Before I proceed, I want to inform you that you can also consider sending a legal notice to the seller detailing the particulars of the complaint, relief sought, and cautioning them of legal recourse in the event of non-compliance. This can be a precursor to filing a complaint.


Would you like me to guide you on how to draft a legal notice or proceed with the application for condonation of delay?


Human: Condonation


AI: I'll help you draft an application for condonation of delay.


As per the guidelines, the application should be notarized and attested. I can provide you with a sample template, but please note that it's essential to get it notarized and attested before submitting it to the District Forum.


Here's a sample template:

Also, please ensure that you attach all supporting documents, including medical records and proof of hospitalization, to the application.


Would you like me to guide you on how to proceed with submitting the application to the District Forum?


Human: Yes


AI: To proceed, you'll need to file the application for condonation of delay along with your complaint and supporting documents through the e-Daakhil portal or in-person at the District Forum.


Here's a step-by-step guide:


1. Ensure you have a valid user ID and password for the e-Daakhil portal.

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help.


You've been waiting for 10 years for your house to be completed, which is a long time. Considering the arbitration clause in the contract, I'd like to clarify a few details.


Can you please tell me what led to this issue - was it a delay in construction, poor quality of work, or something else?


Human: there was inordinate delay in the construction 


AI: Inordinate delay in construction can be a significant issue. Since it's been 10 years since you paid the developer, I'd like to check if the limitation period is still applicable. The time limit for filing a complaint is two years from the date the cause of action arises, as per Section 35 of the Consumer Protection Act. 


Since today's date is 2024-10-08, and the incident occurred more than 2 years ago, the limitation period has already passed. However, the Act allows the District Forum to consider complaints even after the limitation period if they deem the reasons for the delay genuine and valid. 


Considering this, I would advise you to consult with a lawyer or the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) to discuss your options.


Can you please tell me about the developer - what is their name and contact information?


Human: isn't the cause of action subsisting 


AI: You are correct that the cause of action is subsisting in your case, as the delay in construction is an ongoing issue. This means that the limitation period is still applicable, and you can file a complaint within the next two years from the date you became aware of the delay.


Since you're aware of the delay now, I'd like to proceed with gathering more information. 


Can you please tell me what relief are you seeking from the developer - are you looking for a refund, compensation, or completion of the house?


Human: all of the above 


AI: You're seeking a refund, compensation, and completion of the house. 


Given your situation, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint and a legal notice to the developer. This will help you document your grievances and provide a clear timeline for the developer to respond and rectify the situation.


I can assist you in drafting a sample legal notice. However, please note that it's always best to consult with a lawyer to ensure it's tailored to your specific case.


Before we proceed, I'd like to inform you about the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the e-daakhil portal, where you can file your complaint online. These resources can provide you with immediate assistance and guidance.


Would you like me to provide you with a sample draft of the legal notice, or would you like to proceed with filing a complaint through the National Consumer Helpline or e-daakhil portal?


Human: I'd like to proceed with filing a complaint 


AI: To file a complaint, you can use the e-daakhil portal. I can guide you through the process.


As per the information provided earlier, to file a complaint on the e-daakhil portal, you'll need to follow these steps:

Would you like me to help you with the affidavit or any other part of the complaint?


Human: which forum should i file this with 


AI: Based on the information provided, you have the option to file a complaint with the following forums:


1. **District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF)**: Since the amount involved is Rs. 1.5 crores, which is within the jurisdiction of the District Commission, you can file a complaint with the DCDRF.
2. **State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC)**: If you're not satisfied with the decision of the DCDRF, you can appeal to the SCDRC.
3. **National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)**: As the amount involved is above Rs. 10 crores, the NCDRC has jurisdiction over this case.


Considering the amount involved and the nature of the complaint, I would recommend filing the complaint with the **District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF)**.


Please note that you should check the jurisdiction of the DCDRF in your area and ensure that it has the necessary authority to hear your case.


Additionally, you can also consider approaching the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) or the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (CREDAI) for redressal of your grievances.


Would you like me to provide you with the contact details of the DCDRF or any other relevant authorities?


Human: shouldn't I file this with the state commission 


AI: Since the amount involved is Rs. 1.5 crores, which is above the jurisdiction of the District Commission, you should file the complaint with the **State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC)**.


The District Commission has jurisdiction for cases where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed Rs. 1 crore. Since your case involves an amount of Rs. 1.5 crores, the SCDRC has the necessary jurisdiction to hear your complaint.


I would recommend filing the complaint with the SCDRC. I can help you with the draft complaint and provide guidance on the process.


Would you like me to assist you with drafting the complaint and providing information on the SCDRC's contact details?


Human: no thank you

Human: yes. there was delay in construction 


AI: Delays in construction can be frustrating and stressful.


Can you please tell me when you paid the 1.5 crores to the developer and when you first noticed the delay? Also, did you have a written agreement or contract with the developer that specified a completion date or a timeline for the project?


Human: the house was supposed to be built by 2022


AI: Since the project was supposed to be completed by 2022, and it's been 5 years since you paid the developer, I would like to caution you that the 2-year statute of limitations for filing a consumer complaint may have already expired. However, we can still explore other options.


Can you please tell me more about the developer? What is the name of the developer, and do you have any contact information for them?


Human: isn't the cause of action subsisting 


AI: You are correct that the cause of action for a consumer dispute is subsisting, even if the statute of limitations has expired. In India, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, allows consumers to file complaints even if the limitation period has expired, if the cause of action is still subsisting.


Given that your house is only half completed, it's likely that the cause of action is still subsisting.


Let's focus on the next steps. Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you looking for? Are you seeking a refund, completion of the project, or something else?


Human: all of it

As per the information provided in the context, you can file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and also approach the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) if the project is registered with them.


I can help you draft a legal notice to the developer, which is the first step in filing a complaint.


Would you like me to provide you with a draft legal notice that you can send to the developer?

2. The developer's name and address
3. The project name and location

However, you can also file a complaint with the State Commission, as the NCDRC has appellate jurisdiction over the State Commission. But since the value of the complaint is above ₹1 crore, it's recommended to file it directly with the NCDRC.


You can also consider filing a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) if the project is registered with them. But since you haven't mentioned the project name, I'm assuming it's not registered with RERA.


Please note that you can also approach any other judicial or quasi-judicial body as per your convenience.

Human: after the first use itself, i got burns. i had to go to the hospital and get surgery done 


AI: That must have been a distressing experience. 


Since the incident happened recently, we have enough time to take action.

Since you haven't mentioned the exact date of the incident, I'm assuming it's within the time frame.

Human: approach consumer forum 


AI: You can approach the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRC) for redressal of your grievance. Since the value of the goods (foundation) exceeds 1 crore, you can file a complaint with the National Commission.


Before we proceed, I want to inform you that the CDRC operates at the District, State, and National levels. You can file a complaint with the District Commission, but since the value exceeds 1 crore, it's best to file it with the National Commission.


To move forward, I can provide you with a draft of the complaint and the legal notice that you can use as a starting point. Would you like me to proceed with that?

AI: It's been 5 months since the court order, and you still haven't received the compensation and refund. In such a case, you may need to take further action to ensure the opposite party complies with the court order.

In this case, you may want to consider filing a contempt of court petition against the opposite party for not complying with the court order. This can be done through the court where the original order was passed.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the police and the Bar Council of India (BCI) for not complying with the court order.

Human: I don't know. It was in my locker. I pulled it out. It was blackish

Can you please tell me when you first noticed the earrings were blackish? Was it immediately when you took them out, or was it after some time? Also, did you check the hall mark again to see if it's still visible?


Human: Hall mark certificate I have


AI: Having the hall mark certificate is a good start. Since the earrings are hall marked, it's likely that they are supposed to be made of a certain purity of gold. 


You mentioned that the jeweler told you it's gold plated, but the hall mark certificate might indicate otherwise. Can you please check the hall mark certificate to see what the purity of gold is mentioned (e.g., 916, 958, etc.) and also check if the jeweler's name or the assaying and hallmarking centre's mark is mentioned on the earrings?


Human: 916, ABC Jewellers


AI: With the hall mark certificate, you can verify the purity of gold and the authenticity of the earrings.


Since the jeweler has told you that the earrings are gold plated, but the hall mark certificate indicates they are 916 gold, it seems there might be a dispute here. You may want to consider getting the earrings tested to confirm their composition.


Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that the incident happened within the last year, which is within the statutory time limit for filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. 


Would you like to consider taking any further action against the jeweler, or would you like to try to resolve the issue amicably with them?


Human: Action


AI: Given that you'd like to take further action, I can guide you through the process.


First, let's draft a legal notice to the jeweler, ABC Jewellers. A legal notice is a formal document that outlines the complaint and demands a resolution. I can help you with the draft.


To proceed, I'll need some information from you. Can you please provide me with the following details:


1. Your full name and address
2. The jeweler's full name and address (as per the hall mark certificate)
3. A clear statement of the complaint, including the facts and the remedy sought (e.g., replacement, refund, etc.)
4. Any other relevant details, such as the date of purchase, amount paid, etc.


Please provide these details, and I'll help you draft a legal notice.


Human: Can I draft it against the hallmarking centre?


AI: You can draft a complaint against the hallmarking centre as well, but first, let's address the issue with the jeweler, ABC Jewellers. Since they are the ones who sold you the earrings, it's best to start with them.


However, if you'd like to also involve the hallmarking centre, you can do so later. The hallmarking centre's role is to verify the purity of gold, but they are not directly responsible for the sale or quality of the jewelry.


To proceed with drafting the legal notice against the jeweler, please provide me with the details I requested earlier. If you'd like to involve the hallmarking centre later, we can discuss that as well.


Also, would you like to file the complaint online through the e-daakhil portal (https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/) or through a consumer court?

Subject: Complaint against sale of sub-standard gold earrings


Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Sale of gold earrings bearing Hall Mark No. [Hall Mark Number]


I, [Your Name], residing at [Your Address], hereby bring to your notice that I had purchased a pair of gold earrings from your shop on [Date of Purchase] for an amount of [Amount Paid]. The earrings were hall marked with the purity of gold as 916 and were sold to me by your representative.


However, within a short span of [Time Period, e.g., one year], the earrings have turned blackish, which is a clear indication of sub-standard quality. I had taken the earrings to your shop and was informed by your representative that the earrings are gold plated, which is contrary to the hall mark certificate.


I request you to take immediate action to resolve this issue and provide me with a suitable remedy, such as replacement or refund of the amount paid, along with compensation for the inconvenience caused.


Please acknowledge receipt of this notice and inform me of the steps you will take to resolve this issue within [Time Period, e.g., 15 days].

Please note that this is just a template, and you should modify it according to your specific situation. Also, make sure to keep a copy of the notice for your records.


Before sending the notice, I would like to remind you to also register a complaint on the GAMA portal (http://gama.gov.in) along with a copy of the advertisement (if any) or the hall mark certificate and the notice. This will help bring the issue to the notice of the Government.


Would you like to proceed with sending the notice or would you like to modify it further?


Human: Do Hall Mark certificates have a expiry?


AI: According to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Hall Mark certificates do not have an expiry date. The Hall Mark is a certification mark that indicates the purity of gold in the jewelry, and it is valid for the lifetime of the product.


However, the BIS does conduct surprise inspections and testing of samples to ensure that the jewelry is made of the claimed purity of gold. If the testing reveals that the jewelry does not meet the standards, the Hall Mark may be withdrawn, and the jeweler may face legal action.


In your case, since the Hall Mark certificate is still valid, and you have a complaint against the jeweler, we can proceed with the draft legal notice as previously discussed.


Also, I would like to remind you to contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance and guidance on the next steps to take. They can provide you with more information and support.

I was told that delivery of the car would be done on 17.10.20. When I felt dealer will not fulful his promise, I got mentioned delivery date which was mentioned as 24.10.20. In the meantime, my loan was sanctioned by bank and Rs. 500000/- were credited to dealer's account on 13.10.20 but now dealer is saying car would be delivered around 30.10.20. It seems he would not be able to fulfil his promise even on 30.10.20. What should I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue with the dealer not fulfilling the promised delivery date? Was there any communication or agreement between you and the dealer regarding the delivery date, or was it an oral agreement?


Human: oral agreement 


AI: Since the delivery date was not mentioned on the Commitment Form and was only verbally agreed upon, it may be considered an oral agreement. This can be a grey area, and it's essential to document the agreement in writing to avoid any future disputes.


Can you please tell me the current date? Today's date is 2024-10-08. Since your incident occurred on 06.10.20, it is within the 2-year time frame, and you can still pursue a complaint.

AI: You don't have the exact address, phone number, and contact person's name of TATA Treo, Safdarjung, New Delhi. That's okay. We can still proceed with the complaint process.


Since the dealer has already received the loan amount of Rs. 500,000 from the bank on 13.10.20, and they're now delaying the delivery of the car, it seems like they're not fulfilling their commitment.


Have you received any communication from the dealer regarding the delay, and if so, what was their reason for the delay?


Human: they said ""unavoidable circumstances""


AI: The dealer mentioned ""unavoidable circumstances"" as the reason for the delay. This is a vague reason, and it's essential to clarify what these circumstances are.

Dear Sir/Madam,


Re: Delay in Delivery of TATA Tiago Car (Registration No. [Registration Number])


This notice is to bring to your attention the significant delay in the delivery of the TATA Tiago car (Registration No. [Registration Number]) that I booked on 06.10.2020. Despite the initial commitment of delivery on 17.10.2020, and subsequent promises of delivery on 24.10.2020 and 30.10.2020, the car has still not been delivered.

I hereby demand that you:


1. Deliver the TATA Tiago car (Registration No. [Registration Number]) to me within the next 7 days from the date of receipt of this notice.
2. Provide a written explanation for the delay and the reasons for not fulfilling the initial commitment.

Human: I approached a lawyer with my grievance. He went ahead with the case and I won. Now I realise that the lawyer did not have Bar Council registration. What to do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'd like to help you with this issue. Can you please tell me what led to your realization that the lawyer did not have Bar Council registration? Was there a specific incident or a point in time when you discovered this?


Human: I got to know


AI: It seems like you've recently found out that the lawyer didn't have Bar Council registration. Since you've already won the case, it's essential to consider what you'd like to do next.


Could you please tell me when you first approached the lawyer and when you discovered that he didn't have Bar Council registration? Is it within the last 2 years? (Today's date is 2024-10-08)


Human: Will this affect my case?


AI: Since you've already won the case, it's unlikely that this issue will affect the outcome of your original case. However, it's essential to consider taking action against the unregistered lawyer to prevent others from being misled.


Would you like to consider filing a complaint against the lawyer for practicing without a valid Bar Council registration? If so, I can guide you on the next steps, including drafting a complaint and the necessary documentation.


Human: Yes


AI: To file a complaint, you'll need to provide some details. Could you please provide me with the lawyer's name, address, and contact information? Additionally, you'll need to mention the date you signed the vakalatnama (power of attorney) and any promises he made regarding his representation in court. 


Also, please describe how the lawyer's absence affected your case, such as any missed deadlines, adverse rulings, or damage to your case. This will help you clearly state what you're seeking as a remedy.


Human: Which authorities I can complain to?


AI: You can complain to the Bar Council of India or the State Bar Council where the lawyer is registered (or should have been registered). You can also approach the State Consumer Commission or the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, as the lawyer's deficiency in service (practicing without registration) can be considered a consumer grievance.


Additionally, you can also consider filing a complaint with the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) or the State Legal Services Authority, as they provide free legal aid and can help you navigate the process.


Before taking any action, it's essential to consider the statute of limitations, which is 2 years from the date you discovered the lawyer's unregistered practice. Since you're approaching this now, you should be within the time limit.


If you'd like, I can help you draft a complaint or provide more information on the process.


Would you like to proceed with drafting a complaint or seek more information?


Human: Yes draft a complaint


AI: Based on the information you provided, I'll draft a sample complaint. Please note that this is a general template, and you should modify it to fit your specific situation.

Human: i bought a weapon but it is not working properly.


AI: I can't answer that. I can help you with consumer-related issues. Can you please share your consumer grievance?


Human: I have bought it legally


AI: I still can't assist with general product queries. However, I'd be happy to help with any issues you're facing with the product. Can you please share more details about the problem you're experiencing with the weapon, such as what's not working properly and when you first noticed the issue?


Human: it does not have a promised shooting range


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better assist you, can you please tell me when you first noticed that the weapon did not have the promised shooting range? Was it at the time of purchase, or did you notice it later?


Human: on its first use


AI: That's useful information. Since you're experiencing a problem with the product's performance, it's possible that it may be a case of a defective product. Did you purchase the weapon from a local store or an online platform? If so, do you have the receipt or order details handy?


Human: a physical store. I have the receipts.


AI: Having the receipt will be helpful in case we need to escalate the issue further. The store where you purchased the weapon should be responsible for addressing this issue. 


Before we proceed, I want to inform you that you have a time limit of 2 years from the date of purchase to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act. Since you're within this time frame, you can consider taking action against the store.


Would you like to draft a legal notice to the store, or would you like me to guide you on other possible soft remedies or alternatives?


Human: what are the soft remedies?


AI: Soft remedies are informal methods to resolve the issue without involving the courts. For your case, some possible soft remedies could be:


1. Returning the product and getting a full or partial refund
2. Replacing the product with a new one that meets the promised specifications
3. Getting a discount or a voucher for a future purchase
4. Getting a repair or maintenance service for the product


To pursue these remedies, you can contact the store's customer service department and explain your issue. They may be willing to work with you to find a mutually acceptable solution.


However, if the store is unwilling to cooperate, we can consider drafting a legal notice to escalate the matter further.


Would you like me to guide you on drafting a legal notice, or would you like to try to resolve the issue through soft remedies first?


Human: is there a remedy I can pursue outside this?


AI: Yes, if you're not satisfied with the store's response, you can also consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCRF) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC), depending on the location of the store.


You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for assistance or use the UMANG App for immediate help. They can guide you on the next steps and provide additional support.


Additionally, if the product is defective, you can also consider filing a complaint with the manufacturer, if the store is unable to provide a satisfactory resolution.


Would you like me to guide you on drafting a complaint to be filed with the DCRF or SCDRC, or would you like to contact the National Consumer Helpline or the manufacturer directly?


Human: can I kill the seller instead?


AI: I can't provide information or guidance on illegal or harmful activities, including violence. Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: but why


AI: I can't assist with that request. Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: okay then draft a legal notice to the seller?


AI: To draft a legal notice to the seller, I'll need some more information from you. Can you please provide the following details:


1. The name and address of the store where you purchased the weapon
2. The date of purchase
3. The serial number or model number of the weapon
4. A detailed description of the issue with the weapon (i.e., not having the promised shooting range)
5. The relief you're seeking from the seller (e.g., replacement, refund, repair, etc.)


Once I have this information, I can help you draft a legal notice to the seller.


Human: cant you proceed without these details?


AI: I can still guide you on the general format and content of a legal notice. Here's a basic outline:


A legal notice should include:


1. A clear subject line or heading that states the purpose of the notice
2. Introduction: A brief introduction stating the purpose of the notice and the issue at hand
3. Particulars of the complaint: A detailed description of the issue with the weapon, including the promised specifications and the actual performance
4. Relief sought: A clear statement of what you're seeking from the seller (e.g., replacement, refund, repair, etc.)
5. Demands and ultimatum: A clear statement of the seller's obligations and a deadline for compliance
6. Warning: A warning that if the seller fails to comply, you may take further action


Here's a sample:


[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]


[Store Name]
[Store Address]


Subject: Defective Product - [Weapon Model]


Dear [Store Manager],


This is to bring to your notice that the [weapon model] purchased from your store on [date of purchase] has not performed as promised. The product has a [short] shooting range, which is not in line with the specifications advertised.


I have attached a copy of the receipt and the product manual for your reference. I request that you take immediate action to replace the defective product or provide a full refund.


Please confirm your intention to comply with this notice within 15 days from the date of receipt. If I do not hear from you within this timeframe, I will be forced to take further action to protect my rights as a consumer.


Sincerely,
[Your Name]


Please note that this is a basic template, and you should adjust it according to your specific situation and needs. Also, keep in mind that sending a legal notice is not mandatory, and you can directly approach the consumer forum if you're not satisfied with the seller's response.


Would you like me to help you with anything else?"

Human: No issue that I am facing with a product. My products have no defects.


AI: In that case, I can provide you with general tips on marketing your consumer product to Gen Z. However, I'd like to ask a question to better understand your situation.

Human: Hey, I had bought a pet dog. It was promised to be single coat but it turned out to be a double coat. What do I do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd be happy to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was the seller or breeder dishonest about the dog's coat type, or was it an honest mistake?


Human: I belive he was dishonest


AI: It seems like you suspect the seller or breeder of being dishonest about the dog's coat type. That's a serious issue.


To proceed, can you please tell me when you purchased the dog? Was it recently or a few years ago? This is important to know because there's a time limit of 2 years to file a consumer complaint in India, and we need to check if it's still within that timeframe.


Human: I got it in March 2023


AI: Since you purchased the dog in March 2023, it's well within the 2-year timeframe to file a consumer complaint.


Can you please provide me with more information about the seller or breeder? What is their name, address, or any other contact details you might have? This will help me guide you further on the next steps.


Human: Rohan's Pet Shop, it is in Dwarka, Delhi. I tried contacting them but they said it was an honest mistake and they cannot exchange the dog anymore.

To start, I'll need to draft a complaint that includes your details, the seller's details (Rohan's Pet Shop, Dwarka, Delhi), and the facts of the case. I'll also need to include a brief description of the issue, the relief you're seeking, and an affidavit signed and verified by you.


Would you like me to proceed with drafting the complaint, or would you like to take a look at the process first?


Human: i would like to proceed with drafting

Human: yes, can you help me plan a weekly schedule so that I can adequately care for my pet?


AI: I'd be happy to help you plan a weekly schedule for caring for your pet.


However, I want to clarify that my primary role is to assist with consumer grievances, and I'm not a pet care expert. Nevertheless, I can provide you with some general tips and a basic schedule to get you started.


To create a suitable schedule, I'll need to know a bit more about your pet's needs and your lifestyle. Can you please provide me with the following information:


* What is your pet's breed, age, and size?
* What are their dietary needs (e.g., food type, frequency of feeding)?
* Do they require any regular exercise or playtime?
* Do they have any medical conditions or allergies that need to be considered?
* How many hours a day will you be available to care for your pet?
* Do you have any other pets in the household that may need to be considered?


With this information, I can help you create a basic schedule that suits your pet's needs and your lifestyle.


(Note: Please keep in mind that this is a basic schedule, and you may need to adjust it based on your pet's specific needs and your personal circumstances.)


Human: My pet is a double coat german shepard. He is 10 months old, he is big. He eats meets twice a day. He goes out for walks twice a day and needs to play as well. They dont have any medical condition or allergies. I am available for 4 hours a day. I dont have any other pets.

Human: I bought some cake from this small store and ever since I have eaten that, I am sick


AI: I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Thank you for sharing this with me. 


To help me better understand your situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was the cake you bought from this store past its expiration date, or was it something else?


Human: no, it was not over its expiration date. It seemed okay


AI: So, the cake seemed fine when you bought it, but you've been experiencing issues after consuming it. 


Can you please tell me when this incident happened? Was it recently or a while back? (Please note that the statute of limitations for consumer grievances in India is 2 years. If the incident is older than 2 years, we may need to consider that while moving forward.)


Human: it was a week ago


AI: Since the incident happened a week ago, you're well within the statute of limitations.


To proceed, can you please tell me about the opposing party - the small store where you bought the cake? Do you have their name or contact information?


Human: it was called the star store, I bought it through their insta store


AI: So, the store is called ""The Star Store"" and you made the purchase through their Instagram store. 


Have you approached the store with your complaint yet, and if so, what was their response? Or are you looking to file a complaint and seek a desired relief, such as a refund or compensation?


Human: the thing is, I am sure sure if it was the cake or something else that I ate


AI: It can be challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. In that case, we can still consider filing a complaint, but we'll need to be cautious about making any claims. 


Considering the situation, we can start with a soft remedy. Have you tried reaching out to The Star Store's customer service or Instagram support to inform them about the issue and ask for their assistance? They might be willing to help or provide a refund or replacement, depending on their policies.


Human: I told them that their cake might have caused the issue but they say that the cake was baked just that day so it is highly unlikely that the cake could have caused the issue


AI: The store is denying any responsibility, claiming that the cake was freshly baked. 


In this case, we can consider drafting a legal notice to The Star Store, stating your concerns and seeking a formal investigation into the matter. This will give them an opportunity to respond and provide evidence to support their claim.


Would you like me to help you draft a sample legal notice?


Human: okay I guess


AI: To draft a sample legal notice, I'll need some more information from you. 


Can you please provide me with your full name, contact details (address, phone number, and email), and a clear statement of the relief you're seeking from The Star Store? 


Also, are you planning to file the complaint through the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the e-daakhil portal (http://edaakhil.nic.in/)?


Human: I am Riya Singh. My phone no is 47489393. My address is 9373, HSR Delhi. I want compensation of Rs 10000. I can file complaint wherever it would be convenient.


AI: Thank you for providing the necessary information, Riya. I'll help you draft a sample legal notice.

Human: hi


AI: I'm here to help with any consumer-related issues you might be facing. Could you please share your concern or the issue you're facing?


Human: I rented a pg. For 5 days, the geyser is giving electric shocks and the owner is not fixing it. What to do?


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. 


To help me better understand the issue, can you please tell me what led to the geyser giving electric shocks? Was it a sudden occurrence or has it been happening since you moved in?


Human: Sudden


AI: Since the issue with the geyser is sudden, it's essential to address it promptly. 


Can you please tell me when this incident happened? Was it today, yesterday, or sometime in the past?


Human: 5 days since


AI: The issue has been ongoing for 5 days.


Considering the geysers are giving electric shocks, it's a safety concern and the owner is not fixing it. Have you tried talking to the owner again or sending a notice to them regarding this issue?


Human: Yes told owner several times


AI: You've already communicated with the owner multiple times, but they haven't taken any action to fix the issue.


In this case, since the issue is related to safety and the owner is not taking responsibility, you may want to consider taking legal action. I can help you draft a legal notice to the owner, which is the first step in filing a consumer complaint.


Before we proceed, can you please tell me if you're looking for a refund, repair, or replacement of the geyser, or something else?


Human: Repair


AI: You're looking for the geyser to be repaired.


I can help you draft a legal notice to the owner, which will give them a chance to rectify the issue. However, if they still don't respond or fix the issue, you can then file a complaint with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRC) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC).


Before we proceed with drafting the notice, I'd like to inform you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) is available for immediate assistance. You can also download the UMANG App for further assistance.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of drafting a legal notice, or would you like to contact the National Consumer Helpline for immediate assistance?

Re: Defective Geyser in the PG Accommodation at [Your Address]


This is to bring to your notice that the geyser in the PG accommodation at [Your Address] has been giving electric shocks since [Date] and despite multiple requests, the issue has not been addressed. As a result, it poses a serious safety risk to the residents.


We hereby demand that you take immediate action to repair or replace the geyser to ensure the safety of the residents. We request that you take the necessary steps to rectify the issue within 7 days from the date of receipt of this notice.


If we do not hear from you or see any action taken within the stipulated time frame, we will be forced to take legal action to protect our rights as consumers.

Human: Which regulators apart from consumer forum can I approach?


AI: In addition to the Consumer Forum, there are other regulators you can approach for assistance. Considering your issue is related to a PG accommodation, you may want to contact the local authorities responsible for housing or tenancy regulations.


However, based on the information provided earlier, I found that there are regulatory bodies related to consumer protection and services, such as:


1. Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) - As the issue is related to the geyser, which is an electrical appliance, you may want to contact KERC to report the issue and seek assistance.
2. Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (KSDRC) - As a consumer, you can file a complaint with the KSDRC if you're not satisfied with the response from the owner or the Consumer Forum.


You can also contact the local authorities, such as the Collector or the District Collector, who can investigate and assist in resolving the issue.


Please note that these regulatory bodies may have their own procedures and timelines for addressing complaints. It's essential to research and understand their processes before approaching them.


Would you like me to provide more information on these regulatory bodies or their contact details?


Human: No

Human: I went to a doctor. He referred me to another doctor who gave me a medicine that caused me severe irritation. I want to file a case against both the doctors.


AI: Thank you for sharing your concern. I'm here to help you with your consumer grievance.


To better understand your issue, can you please tell me what led to the severe irritation caused by the medicine? Was it an allergic reaction or some other adverse effect?


Human: Allergy maybe


AI: It seems like you're not entirely sure if it was an allergy or something else. That's okay. Can you please tell me when this incident happened? Was it recently or a while back?


Human: Recently


AI: Since the incident happened recently, we should be within the time limit to file a complaint. However, to be sure, I need to know the exact date of the incident. Also, can you please provide me with the details of the doctors involved, such as their names and contact information?


Human: Can you draft me a complaint?


AI: Based on the information you provided, I can guide you on the format of the complaint. However, to draft a complaint, I'll need a bit more information.

Also, since you mentioned filing a complaint against the doctors, I want to inform you that you may also want to consider filing a complaint with the Medical Council of India or the State Medical Council, as mentioned in the guidelines. Would you like me to guide you through that process as well?


Human: Can I file a complaint against both doctors?


AI: Yes, you can file a complaint against both doctors. Since you mentioned that the first doctor referred you to the second doctor, you can file a complaint against both of them for their alleged negligence and failure to provide proper medical care.


In your complaint, you can mention that the first doctor was responsible for referring you to the second doctor, and the second doctor was responsible for prescribing the medicine that caused the severe irritation. You can also mention that both doctors failed to provide proper care and attention, leading to the adverse effects you experienced.


If you'd like, I can help you draft a sample complaint that includes both doctors. However, please note that you'll need to provide more details about the specific actions or omissions of each doctor that led to the adverse effects.


Also, I want to remind you that you can also consider filing a complaint with the Medical Council of India or the State Medical Council, as mentioned in the guidelines. This can be done in addition to filing a complaint against the doctors.
