Chat:  ﻿Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
What are the steps to get a refund for a defective product?
To get a refund for a defective product, I'd like to guide you through the process.


Can you please tell me what led to the issue with the defective product? Was it damaged during shipping, or was it defective upon delivery, or something else?
during usage
So the product became defective during usage. That helps narrow it down.


Can you please tell me about the product itself? What is the brand name, model number, and approximate purchase date?
brand name philips. model number BT3101/15. purchase date one week ago
You purchased a Philips product, model number BT3101/15, about a week ago.


Since the product became defective during usage, you may want to try contacting the customer care of Philips first to report the issue and see if they can assist you with a repair or replacement. If not, we can explore other options.


Can you please tell me what kind of issue is the product experiencing? Is it not turning on, not charging, or something else?


Also, do you have the receipt or invoice for the purchase?
customer care not reachable. it blew a fuse when i was using it. i have the receipt
I'm sorry to hear that the customer care is unreachable, and the product blew a fuse while in use.


Having the receipt is a good start. Since the product is a Philips item, you can try contacting the Philips customer care through their website or social media channels. If that doesn't work, we can proceed with filing a complaint.


You can also consider visiting the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take.


Before we proceed, I'd like to know what kind of relief are you seeking? Are you looking for a replacement, refund, or something else?
either replacement or full refund.
You're seeking either a replacement or a full refund for the defective product.


As the customer care is unreachable, we can consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) depending on the location.


Before we proceed, I'd like to guide you through the process of filing a complaint. Do you want me to provide you with the draft of a legal notice that you can use to initiate the process?


Additionally, I can also provide you with the contact details of the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the e-daakhil portal (edaakhil.nic.in) where you can file your complaint online.
