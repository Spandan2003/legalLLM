0,"﻿AI: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.


Human: Hi I got a tattoo and now I have developed an infection due to it. The tattoo parlour is saying they are not liable and I might have had some allergy which I did not disclose. Is it possible to file a consumer grievance over this?


AI: I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Yes, it is possible to file a consumer grievance in this case. As a consumer, you have the right to seek redressal for any harm or injury caused by a service provider, including a tattoo parlour.


To move forward, can you please provide more details about what happened? For instance, what type of tattoo did you get, and when did you get it done? Also, have you contacted the tattoo parlour to report the issue and seek a resolution?


Human: I got this done in XYZ tattoos in Hyderabad in a mall. I got a scorpion done and this was a week ago. I have contacted them but they said they are not liable for this.


AI: It seems like a clear case of deficiency in service. As per the Consumer Protection Act 2019, a service provider like a tattoo parlour is responsible for ensuring that the services they provide are safe and do not cause harm to the consumer.


Since you've already contacted the tattoo parlour and they've denied liability, it's time to consider filing a consumer complaint. Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief you're seeking from the tattoo parlour? Are you looking for compensation for the medical expenses, compensation for the pain and discomfort, or something else?


Human: I need them to cover my medical expenses 


AI: Covering medical expenses is a reasonable expectation from a service provider like a tattoo parlour. Since the tattoo parlour has denied liability, you may need to take further action to seek compensation.


As a first step, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, stating the details of the incident, the harm caused, and the relief you're seeking. I can provide you with a sample draft if you'd like.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide you with the contact details of the relevant consumer court or authority to file a complaint.


Before we proceed, I have one more question: Do you have any evidence or documentation to support your claim, such as photographs of the tattoo, medical reports, or communication with the tattoo parlour?


Human: I have photograph which I took later and the doctor's prescription for infection but the prescription does not say where I got the infection from. No I don't have the communication from the parlour as it was on call.


AI: Having a photograph of the tattoo and a doctor's prescription is a good starting point for your complaint. Even though the prescription doesn't specify the exact source of the infection, it's still a medical document that supports your claim of harm caused by the tattoo parlour.


Not having a written communication from the parlour on call can make it a bit more challenging, but we can still proceed with drafting a complaint letter and filing a case.


As a next step, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, and also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana.


Before we proceed, I want to inform you that you can also file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal, which is a government initiative to facilitate online filing of consumer complaints. Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint online?


Human: Other than the helpline is there any way I can reach out to a consumer grievance officeR?


AI: Yes, in addition to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000), you can also reach out to the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana. The SDRC is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the state level.


To find the contact details of the SDRC in Telangana, you can visit the National Consumer Helpline website (nch.nic.in) and search for the contact information of the SDRC in Telangana. You can also try searching online for ""Telangana State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission"" or ""Telangana Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum"".


Alternatively, you can also contact the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in the district where the tattoo parlour is located. The DCDRF is the first level of consumer dispute redressal at the district level.


Additionally, you can also contact the Consumer Affairs Department of the Government of Telangana, which is responsible for handling consumer complaints and grievances in the state. You can find their contact details on the official website of the Government of Telangana.


It's worth noting that you can also contact the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), which is a national-level body responsible for protecting consumer rights. However, as this is a state-level issue, it's best to start with the state-level authorities first.


Would you like me to provide you with the contact details of the CCPA or the Consumer Affairs Department of Telangana?


Human: No but can you draft a complaint for this for me?


AI: Here's a draft complaint letter that you can use as a template:


**Complaint Letter**


To,
XYZ Tattoos
[Address of the tattoo parlour]


Subject: Deficiency in Service and Request for Compensation


Dear Sir/Madam,


I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue that I am facing due to the service I received at your tattoo parlour on [date of the tattoo]. I had gotten a scorpion tattoo done by your artist, but unfortunately, I have developed an infection at the site of the tattoo.


Despite my best efforts to take care of the tattoo, I have been experiencing severe discomfort and pain, and have been prescribed medication by a doctor. I have attached a copy of the doctor's prescription for your reference.


I had informed your staff about the discomfort and pain I was experiencing, but they assured me that it was a normal reaction and would subside on its own. However, the infection has persisted, and I am now seeking medical attention.


I believe that the infection is a direct result of the substandard service provided by your parlour. As a consumer, I expect a certain level of quality and hygiene in the services provided by your establishment. Unfortunately, it appears that your parlour failed to meet these expectations.


I request that you take immediate action to address this issue and provide me with compensation for the medical expenses incurred due to the infection. I would appreciate it if you could also take steps to ensure that your staff is properly trained to handle such situations in the future.


Please find attached a copy of the doctor's prescription and a photograph of the tattoo. I would appreciate it if you could acknowledge receipt of this complaint and provide a response within the next 7 days.


Sincerely,


[Your Name]


**Attachments:**


* Doctor's prescription
* Photograph of the tattoo


Please note that this is just a draft, and you should modify it to suit your specific situation. Also, make sure to keep a copy of the complaint letter and attachments for your records.


Before sending the complaint letter, I would recommend sending a registered post to the tattoo parlour, and also keeping a record of the tracking number and the date of dispatch. This will help you track the complaint and ensure that it reaches the parlour.


Would you like me to help you with anything else?


Human: Is this not a notice to the other party?


AI: The draft I provided is more of a formal complaint letter, which is typically used after a formal notice has been sent to the opposite party.


A formal notice is a precursor to a complaint, and it's usually sent to the opposite party (in this case, the tattoo parlour) to give them an opportunity to respond and rectify the issue before a complaint is filed.


Here's a revised draft of a notice that you can use:

They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide you with the contact details of the relevant consumer court or authority to file a complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, I have one more question: Do you have any evidence or documentation to support your claim, such as photographs of the tattoo, medical reports, or communication with the tattoo parlour?\nUser: I have photograph which I took later and the doctor\'s prescription for infection but the prescription does not say where I got the infection from. No I don\'t have the communication from the parlour as it was on call.\nChatbot: Having a photograph of the tattoo and a doctor\'s prescription is a good starting point for your complaint. Even though the prescription doesn\'t specify the exact source of the infection, it\'s still a medical document that supports your claim of harm caused by the tattoo parlour.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot having a written communication from the parlour on call can make it a bit more challenging, but we can still proceed with drafting a complaint letter and filing a case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a next step, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, and also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, I want to inform you that you can also file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal, which is a government initiative to facilitate online filing of consumer complaints.

You can also try searching online for ""Telangana State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission"" or ""Telangana Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum"".\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also contact the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in the district where the tattoo parlour is located.

Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: Hi I got a tattoo and now I have developed an infection due to it. The tattoo parlour is saying they are not liable and I might have had some allergy which I did not disclose. Is it possible to file a consumer grievance over this?\nChatbot: I\'m so sorry to hear that you\'re going through this. Yes, it is possible to file a consumer grievance in this case. As a consumer, you have the right to seek redressal for any harm or injury caused by a service provider, including a tattoo parlour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo move forward, can you please provide more details about what happened? For instance, what type of tattoo did you get, and when did you get it done? Also, have you contacted the tattoo parlour to report the issue and seek a resolution?\nUser: I got this done in XYZ tattoos in Hyderabad in a mall. I got a scorpion done and this was a week ago. I have contacted them but they said they are not liable for this.\nChatbot: It seems like a clear case of deficiency in service. As per the Consumer Protection Act 2019, a service provider like a tattoo parlour is responsible for ensuring that the services they provide are safe and do not cause harm to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince you\'ve already contacted the tattoo parlour and they\'ve denied liability, it\'s time to consider filing a consumer complaint. Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief you\'re seeking from the tattoo parlour? Are you looking for compensation for the medical expenses, compensation for the pain and discomfort, or something else?\nUser: I need them to cover my medical expenses\nChatbot: Covering medical expenses is a reasonable expectation from a service provider like a tattoo parlour. Since the tattoo parlour has denied liability, you may need to take further action to seek compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a first step, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, stating the details of the incident, the harm caused, and the relief you\'re seeking. I can provide you with a sample draft if you\'d like.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide you with the contact details of the relevant consumer court or authority to file a complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, I have one more question: Do you have any evidence or documentation to support your claim, such as photographs of the tattoo, medical reports, or communication with the tattoo parlour?\nUser: I have photograph which I took later and the doctor\'s prescription for infection but the prescription does not say where I got the infection from. No I don\'t have the communication from the parlour as it was on call.\nChatbot: Having a photograph of the tattoo and a doctor\'s prescription is a good starting point for your complaint. Even though the prescription doesn\'t specify the exact source of the infection, it\'s still a medical document that supports your claim of harm caused by the tattoo parlour.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot having a written communication from the parlour on call can make it a bit more challenging, but we can still proceed with drafting a complaint letter and filing a case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a next step, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, and also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, I want to inform you that you can also file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal, which is a government initiative to facilitate online filing of consumer complaints. Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint online?\nUser: Other than the helpline is there any way I can reach out to a consumer grievance officeR?\nChatbot: Yes, in addition to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000), you can also reach out to the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana. The SDRC is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the state level.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the contact details of the SDRC in Telangana, you can visit the National Consumer Helpline website (nch.nic.in) and search for the contact information of the SDRC in Telangana. You can also try searching online for ""Telangana State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission"" or ""Telangana Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum"".\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also contact the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in the district where the tattoo parlour is located. The DCDRF is the first level of consumer dispute redressal at the district level.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can also contact the Consumer Affairs Department of the Government of Telangana, which is responsible for handling consumer complaints and grievances in the state. You can find their contact details on the official website of the Government of Telangana.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s worth noting that you can also contact the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), which is a national-level body responsible for protecting consumer rights. However, as this is a state-level issue, it\'s best to start with the state-level authorities first.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you like me to provide you with the contact details of the CCPA or the Consumer Affairs Department of Telangana?\nUser: No but can you draft a complaint for this for me?\nChatbot: Here\'s a draft complaint letter that you can use as a template:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Complaint Letter**\r\n\r\n\r\nTo,\r\nXYZ Tattoos\r\n[Address of the tattoo parlour]\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: Deficiency in Service and Request for Compensation\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue that I am facing due to the service I received at your tattoo parlour on [date of the tattoo]. I had gotten a scorpion tattoo done by your artist, but unfortunately, I have developed an infection at the site of the tattoo.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite my best efforts to take care of the tattoo, I have been experiencing severe discomfort and pain, and have been prescribed medication by a doctor. I have attached a copy of the doctor\'s prescription for your reference.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had informed your staff about the discomfort and pain I was experiencing, but they assured me that it was a normal reaction and would subside on its own. However, the infection has persisted, and I am now seeking medical attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that the infection is a direct result of the substandard service provided by your parlour. As a consumer, I expect a certain level of quality and hygiene in the services provided by your establishment. Unfortunately, it appears that your parlour failed to meet these expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\nI request that you take immediate action to address this issue and provide me with compensation for the medical expenses incurred due to the infection.

I have contacted them but they said they are not liable for this.\nChatbot: It seems like a clear case of deficiency in service. As per the Consumer Protection Act 2019, a service provider like a tattoo parlour is responsible for ensuring that the services they provide are safe and do not cause harm to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince you\'ve already contacted the tattoo parlour and they\'ve denied liability, it\'s time to consider filing a consumer complaint. Before we proceed, can you please tell me what kind of relief you\'re seeking from the tattoo parlour? Are you looking for compensation for the medical expenses, compensation for the pain and discomfort, or something else?\nUser: I need them to cover my medical expenses\nChatbot: Covering medical expenses is a reasonable expectation from a service provider like a tattoo parlour. Since the tattoo parlour has denied liability, you may need to take further action to seek compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a first step, I would recommend drafting a formal complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, stating the details of the incident, the harm caused, and the relief you\'re seeking. I can provide you with a sample draft if you\'d like.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take and provide you with the contact details of the relevant consumer court or authority to file a complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, I have one more question: Do you have any evidence or documentation to support your claim, such as photographs of the tattoo, medical reports, or communication with the tattoo parlour?\nUser: I have photograph which I took later and the doctor\'s prescription for infection but the prescription does not say where I got the infection from. No I don\'t have the communication from the parlour as it was on call.\nChatbot: Having a photograph of the tattoo and a doctor\'s prescription is a good starting point for your complaint. Even though the prescription doesn\'t specify the exact source of the infection, it\'s still a medical document that supports your claim of harm caused by the tattoo parlour.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot having a written communication from the parlour on call can make it a bit more challenging, but we can still proceed with drafting a complaint letter and filing a case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a next step, I can guide you on drafting a complaint letter to the tattoo parlour, and also provide you with information on how to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) and the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, I want to inform you that you can also file a complaint online through the e-daakhil portal, which is a government initiative to facilitate online filing of consumer complaints. Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint online?\nUser: Other than the helpline is there any way I can reach out to a consumer grievance officeR?\nChatbot: Yes, in addition to the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000), you can also reach out to the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SDRC) in Telangana. The SDRC is a quasi-judicial body that deals with consumer disputes at the state level.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the contact details of the SDRC in Telangana, you can visit the National Consumer Helpline website (nch.nic.in) and search for the contact information of the SDRC in Telangana. You can also try searching online for ""Telangana State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission"" or ""Telangana Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum"".\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also contact the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) in the district where the tattoo parlour is located. The DCDRF is the first level of consumer dispute redressal at the district level.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can also contact the Consumer Affairs Department of the Government of Telangana, which is responsible for handling consumer complaints and grievances in the state. You can find their contact details on the official website of the Government of Telangana.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s worth noting that you can also contact the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), which is a national-level body responsible for protecting consumer rights. However, as this is a state-level issue, it\'s best to start with the state-level authorities first.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you like me to provide you with the contact details of the CCPA or the Consumer Affairs Department of Telangana?\nUser: No but can you draft a complaint for this for me?\nChatbot: Here\'s a draft complaint letter that you can use as a template:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Complaint Letter**\r\n\r\n\r\nTo,\r\nXYZ Tattoos\r\n[Address of the tattoo parlour]\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: Deficiency in Service and Request for Compensation\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue that I am facing due to the service I received at your tattoo parlour on [date of the tattoo]. I had gotten a scorpion tattoo done by your artist, but unfortunately, I have developed an infection at the site of the tattoo.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite my best efforts to take care of the tattoo, I have been experiencing severe discomfort and pain, and have been prescribed medication by a doctor. I have attached a copy of the doctor\'s prescription for your reference.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had informed your staff about the discomfort and pain I was experiencing, but they assured me that it was a normal reaction and would subside on its own. However, the infection has persisted, and I am now seeking medical attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that the infection is a direct result of the substandard service provided by your parlour. As a consumer, I expect a certain level of quality and hygiene in the services provided by your establishment. Unfortunately, it appears that your parlour failed to meet these expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\nI request that you take immediate action to address this issue and provide me with compensation for the medical expenses incurred due to the infection.

This will help you track the complaint and ensure that it reaches the parlour.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you like me to help you with anything else?\nUser: Is this not a notice to the other party?\nChatbot: The draft I provided is more of a formal complaint letter, which is typically used after a formal notice has been sent to the opposite party.\r\n\r\n\r\nA formal notice is a precursor to a complaint, and it\'s usually sent to the opposite party (in this case, the tattoo parlour) to give them an opportunity to respond and rectify the issue before a complaint is filed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\'s a revised draft of a notice that you can use:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notice to the Opposite Party**\r\n\r\n\r\nTo,\r\nXYZ Tattoos\r\n[Address of the tattoo parlour]\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: Notice of Deficiency in Service and Demand for Rectification\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir/Madam,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue that I am facing due to the service I received at your tattoo parlour on [date of the tattoo].

AI: Yes, apart from filing a complaint with the Consumer Forum and sending a legal notice to Myntra, you have other remedies available to you. Here are a few:


1. **Mediation**: The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides for mediation as a way to resolve consumer disputes. You can approach the Consumer Mediation Cell or a private mediator to resolve the issue amicably.
2. **RBI Banking Ombudsman**: Since Myntra is an e-commerce company that accepts online payments, you may also approach the RBI Banking Ombudsman if you feel that your bank has not resolved the issue satisfactorily.
3. **State Consumer Commission**: If you are not satisfied with the response from the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, you can appeal to the State Consumer Commission.
4. **National Consumer Helpline**: You can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for assistance and guidance on how to resolve the issue.
5. **State-specific grievance redressal mechanisms**: Some states have their own grievance redressal mechanisms, such as the Karnataka State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.


Please note that these remedies may have different procedures and time limits, and it's essential to understand the specific requirements and deadlines for each option.


Also, I would like to remind you that the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) is available to provide you with immediate assistance and guidance on how to resolve your issue.

To better understand the situation, can you please tell me what led to this issue? Was it a one-time incident or a recurring problem with Uber's pricing?


Human: It was a one time incident but it is a route i take everyday. 


AI: So it seems like the incident occurred on a route you regularly take, and the app initially quoted a lower fare but charged you a higher amount.


I would recommend filing a formal complaint with Uber through their official channels, as you've already done. However, if you're not satisfied with their response, you can also consider taking the following steps:


1.  Check your Uber account: Review your account history to see if there are any similar incidents in the past where the fare was higher than quoted.
2.  Provide evidence: If you have any evidence, such as screenshots or GPS data, that shows the route taken by the driver was the same as usual, you can attach it to your complaint.
3.  Escalate the issue: If Uber's customer support doesn't resolve your issue, you can escalate it to their higher authorities or their social media handles.
4.  Consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for assistance and guidance on the next steps.

Follow-up communications ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and that the customer is content with the outcome. ● Escalation Mechanism - In cases where the customer is dissatisfied with the resolution or believes that the complaint has not been adequately addressed, there may be an escalation mechanism.

To proceed, can you please tell me if you've already reported this incident to the manufacturer or the pharmacy where you purchased the cough syrup?


Human: No I have not reported it to them but i think an issue this serious need to be taken up formally with a consumer complaint


AI: You're right, a formal complaint is the next step to ensure your voice is heard and the manufacturer is held accountable.

1. What is the name of the cough syrup you purchased, and where did you buy it from?
2. Do you have the packaging or the label of the cough syrup with the expiration date mentioned on it?
3. Have you sought medical attention for your stomach infection, and do you have any medical records or bills related to this incident?

Given the severity of the issue, I recommend that you file a complaint with the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and the pharmacy where you purchased the cough syrup, Apollo Medicals.


As the cough syrup was past its expiration date, it's likely a case of product liability. You can claim compensation for the harm caused by the defective product.


Before filing the complaint, I'd like to guide you through the process of drafting a complaint letter. Would you like me to provide a sample template or assist you in writing the complaint letter?


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you through the process and provide further support.


Do you want me to help you draft the complaint letter, or would you like to file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline first?

Do you have any questions or need help with filling out the complaint form?


Human: can I ask the medical shop to take the drug back?


AI: Given that the cough syrup was past its expiration date and caused harm, it's reasonable to ask the medical shop to take the product back.

When you contact them, you can ask to speak to the store manager or the person in charge. Here's a sample script to help you:


""Hello, I'm calling about a product I purchased from your store, Benadryl cough syrup, which was past its expiration date. Unfortunately, I developed a stomach infection after consuming the product. I'd like to request that you take the product back and issue a refund or replace it with a new one. Can you please assist me with this?""


If they agree to take the product back, be sure to get a written acknowledgement or a receipt confirming that they've accepted the return.


Additionally, you can also ask them to provide a written statement or a letter stating that the product was past its expiration date and that they take responsibility for the harm caused.


Having this documentation can be useful when filing your complaint with the National Consumer Helpline or the manufacturer.

Human: I took admission in shiv nadar university for sociology but then got into azim premji. I asked them to return all the admission fees paid and they gave me everything except 65000 which they are saying non-refundable


AI: I'm glad you reached out for help. However, I noticed that your query is not related to a consumer grievance. You're seeking assistance with a matter related to university admissions and fees. I'm a consumer grievance assistance tool, and my primary focus is on helping with consumer-related issues.


If you'd like to discuss this further, I can offer guidance on how to navigate the situation with the university. However, please note that this would not be under the purview of consumer law.


If you're willing, could you please share more about your experience with the university, such as what led you to change your decision, and any communication you've had with them regarding the refund? This will help me better understand your situation and provide more tailored advice.


Human: why is this not under consumer law?


AI: The issue you're facing with the university is related to a contract between you and the institution, specifically regarding admission fees and refunds. While consumer law does protect individuals in certain contractual relationships, the specifics of university admissions and fees can be complex.


In India, the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have guidelines and regulations governing university admissions and fees. These regulations may provide a framework for handling situations like yours.


However, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, primarily focuses on protecting consumers in transactions involving goods and services, particularly in the context of unfair trade practices, defective products, or services, and other consumer-related issues.


That being said, if you feel that the university's actions are unfair or deceptive, you may still be able to seek redressal under consumer law. For instance, if you believe that the university is engaging in unfair trade practices, such as misrepresenting their refund policies or failing to provide a clear refund process, you might be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act.


To clarify, I'd like to ask: Do you believe that the university has engaged in any unfair trade practices or misrepresented their refund policies in your case?


Human: I dont know if there is any unfair practice. UGC guidelines say that all money will be returned if admission is cancelled within the specific time. I cancelled within 2 weeks. Should I not get all my money back?


AI: It sounds like the UGC guidelines provide a clear framework for refund policies in university admissions. If you cancelled your admission within the specified time frame, it seems reasonable that you should be entitled to a full refund.


In this case, it appears that the university is not following the UGC guidelines, as they are withholding a portion of your admission fees. This could be considered a potential unfair trade practice, as the university is not adhering to the regulations that govern their actions.


Given this information, I would recommend that you reach out to the university again and request a full refund, citing the UGC guidelines as the basis for your claim. If they continue to refuse, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or your state's consumer forum, as this could be considered a case of unfair trade practice.


Before we proceed, I'd like to ask: Have you received any communication from the university explaining why they are withholding the remaining amount, or have they simply stated that it's non-refundable?


Human: no they have simply stated it is non refundable


AI: It seems that the university is not providing a clear explanation for withholding the remaining amount, and are simply stating that it's non-refundable.


In this case, I would recommend that you file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or your state's consumer forum. They can help you navigate the situation and provide guidance on how to proceed.


Before we move forward, I'd like to provide you with some information on the next steps you can take.


As per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, if you're not satisfied with the university's response, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which is the first level of consumer court. You can also approach the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, depending on the value of the dispute.


To file a complaint, you'll need to provide the following documents:


1. A written complaint detailing the issue and the relief you're seeking.
2. Proof of payment of the admission fees.
3. UGC guidelines that state that all money should be returned if admission is cancelled within the specified time frame.
4. Any other relevant documents that support your claim.


The National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) can guide you through the process and provide you with the necessary forms and information.


Would you like me to help you draft a complaint letter or provide more information on the process?


Human: can I reach out to UGC instead of consumer commissions?


AI: The University Grants Commission (UGC) is the regulatory body responsible for overseeing university admissions and fees in India. If you're not satisfied with the university's response, it's a good idea to reach out to the UGC to report the issue and seek their assistance.


The UGC can provide guidance on the university's obligations under their guidelines and may be able to help resolve the issue amicably. They may also be able to provide a written clarification on the university's refund policy and ensure that they adhere to the guidelines.


Before reaching out to the UGC, I would recommend that you gather all relevant documents, including:


1. Proof of payment of the admission fees.
2. UGC guidelines that state that all money should be returned if admission is cancelled within the specified time frame.
3. Any communication with the university regarding the refund.
4. A written complaint detailing the issue and the relief you're seeking.


You can file a complaint with the UGC through their website or by contacting their office directly. They will review your case and may contact the university to resolve the issue.


To find the UGC's contact information, you can visit their website at [www.ugc.ac.in](http://www.ugc.ac.in).


Would you like me to provide more information on how to file a complaint with the UGC?


Human: yes


AI: To file a complaint with the University Grants Commission (UGC), you can follow these steps:


1. **Visit the UGC website**: Go to [www.ugc.ac.in](http://www.ugc.ac.in) and click on the ""Contact Us"" tab.

        * Attach supporting documents (e.g., proof of payment, UGC guidelines, communication with the university)
4. **Submit the complaint**: Once you've filled out the form, submit it to the UGC.
5. **Wait for a response**: The UGC will review your complaint and may contact the university to resolve the issue. They will also keep you informed about the progress of your complaint.

The court argued that the examination process is a statutory function and not a service provided for consideration.

I asked them to return all the admission fees paid and they gave me everything except 65000 which they are saying non-refundable\nChatbot: I'm glad you reached out for help. However, I noticed that your query is not related to a consumer grievance. You're seeking assistance with a matter related to university admissions and fees. I'm a consumer grievance assistance tool, and my primary focus is on helping with consumer-related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to discuss this further, I can offer guidance on how to navigate the situation with the university. However, please note that this would not be under the purview of consumer law.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're willing, could you please share more about your experience with the university, such as what led you to change your decision, and any communication you've had with them regarding the refund? This will help me better understand your situation and provide more tailored advice.\nUser: why is this not under consumer law?\nChatbot: The issue you're facing with the university is related to a contract between you and the institution, specifically regarding admission fees and refunds. While consumer law does protect individuals in certain contractual relationships, the specifics of university admissions and fees can be complex.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn India, the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have guidelines and regulations governing university admissions and fees. These regulations may provide a framework for handling situations like yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, primarily focuses on protecting consumers in transactions involving goods and services, particularly in the context of unfair trade practices, defective products, or services, and other consumer-related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said, if you feel that the university's actions are unfair or deceptive, you may still be able to seek redressal under consumer law. For instance, if you believe that the university is engaging in unfair trade practices, such as misrepresenting their refund policies or failing to provide a clear refund process, you might be able to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I'd like to ask: Do you believe that the university has engaged in any unfair trade practices or misrepresented their refund policies in your case?\nUser: I dont know if there is any unfair practice. UGC guidelines say that all money will be returned if admission is cancelled within the specific time. I cancelled within 2 weeks. Should I not get all my money back?\nChatbot: It sounds like the UGC guidelines provide a clear framework for refund policies in university admissions. If you cancelled your admission within the specified time frame, it seems reasonable that you should be entitled to a full refund.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, it appears that the university is not following the UGC guidelines, as they are withholding a portion of your admission fees. This could be considered a potential unfair trade practice, as the university is not adhering to the regulations that govern their actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven this information, I would recommend that you reach out to the university again and request a full refund, citing the UGC guidelines as the basis for your claim. If they continue to refuse, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or your state's consumer forum, as this could be considered a case of unfair trade practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, I'd like to ask: Have you received any communication from the university explaining why they are withholding the remaining amount, or have they simply stated that it's non-refundable?\nUser: no they have simply stated it is non refundable\nChatbot: It seems that the university is not providing a clear explanation for withholding the remaining amount, and are simply stating that it's non-refundable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, I would recommend that you file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or your state's consumer forum. They can help you navigate the situation and provide guidance on how to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we move forward, I'd like to provide you with some information on the next steps you can take.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, if you're not satisfied with the university's response, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which is the first level of consumer court. You can also approach the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, depending on the value of the dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo file a complaint, you'll need to provide the following documents:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Human: I took an Air India flight and my baggage was stuck at the airport for over an hour while we waited


AI: I'm so sorry to hear that you had a frustrating experience with Air India. Can you please tell me more about what happened? What led to your baggage being stuck at the airport for over an hour? Was it due to any specific reason or was it just a delay in the baggage handling process?


Human: They said that it was because the flight was parked very far from the airport


AI: Being far from the airport can indeed cause delays in baggage handling. However, the airline should still ensure that your baggage is handled efficiently and reaches you in a timely manner.


Can you please tell me what kind of relief are you seeking from Air India regarding this incident? Are you looking for a refund, compensation, or something else?


Human: They did not provide us with any refreshments or alternate methods of getting our bags. I missed a conference due to this. I want compensation for the trouble


AI: I understand that not only was your baggage delayed, but you also missed a conference due to the airline's inefficiency. As per the Air India's policy, if a flight is delayed by more than six hours, the airline should offer meals and refreshments to passengers. Since your flight was delayed, you should have been provided with refreshments.


Regarding the compensation, you are eligible for it since you missed a conference due to the airline's delay. The compensation amount can range between ₹5,000 to ₹10,000, depending on the block time (the time between the departure of a flight from the gate and arrival at the destination gate).


I can help you draft a letter to Air India for compensation. Would you like me to provide you with a draft letter? 


Also, I would like to inform you that you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance.

Human: I need gas


AI: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.


Can you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?


Human: i need gas only once


AI: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply. However, please note that you may be required to pay a higher price for a one-time supply compared to a regular refill.


If you face any issues with the distributor or the supply, you can contact the Customer Service Cell of the company for assistance.


Additionally, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for immediate assistance with your consumer grievance.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: the gas cylinder is faulty


AI: A faulty gas cylinder can be a safety hazard and a cause for concern. You should contact your LPG distributor or the company's Customer Service Cell to report the issue and request a replacement.

2. Do you have the receipt or the gas cylinder's serial number handy?
3. Have you already contacted the distributor or the Customer Service Cell regarding this issue?


Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.


Human: i'll call 1906. i don't know what led to the problem. i have serial number. i have not yet contacted service cell


AI: Calling the LPG Emergency Helpline at 1906 is a good first step. Since you're not sure what led to the issue, it's best to report it to the helpline and let them guide you further.


Having the serial number of the gas cylinder will be helpful in their investigation. Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.


After speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.


If you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.

If none of these options work, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission or the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission.

I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.\nUser: I need gas\nChatbot: You're looking for information related to gas, specifically LPG. You can consider it as a consumer grievance. I'm here to help you with that.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you please share the issue you're facing with LPG or the gas supplier? Is it related to a new connection, existing supply, billing, or something else?\nUser: i need gas only once\nChatbot: It seems like you're looking for a one-time gas supply. You can approach the LPG distributor in your area and register for a one-time gas supply.

Since you haven't contacted the service cell yet, the helpline can also assist you in escalating the issue to the next level if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter speaking with the helpline, if you're not satisfied with the response or resolution, you can consider filing a complaint with the District Consumer Commission. You can find more information on the process on the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCPCR) website: http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/districtlist.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, don't forget to note down the reference number or case number provided by the helpline, as you may need it for future reference.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\nUser: yes. no response on the helpline\nChatbot: It can be frustrating when you don't get a response on the helpline.

Human: my car broke down


AI: I'm so sorry to hear that your car broke down. Can you please tell me a bit more about what happened? Was it a sudden breakdown or was it due to some issue that you were aware of earlier?


Human: not sure what the issue is. There is steam coming out of the bonnet


AI: Steam coming out of the bonnet can be a concerning issue. It's possible that it could be a sign of a coolant leak or a problem with the engine. Did you recently purchase the car or has it been with you for a while?


Human: it is four years old


AI: Four years old is still a relatively young car, so it's not necessarily a sign of a major issue. However, it's still possible that there could be a problem with the engine or cooling system.


Have you taken the car to a mechanic or a service center yet to have it checked? And do you have a warranty or any maintenance records that might be relevant to this issue?


Human: it is out of warranty. not sure about maintenance records

To pursue this, you can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCRF) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) in your state, depending on the value of the claim.

3. Photographs or videos of the issue

Under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the DCRF can pass an order for:

AI: Concu is a popular food chain. I'd like to help you with your consumer grievance.


If you haven't already, I would recommend contacting the customer service team of Concu directly to report the incident and seek a resolution.

Before we proceed with any further steps, have you already tried contacting Concu's customer service team about this incident?


Human: they apologised but failed to compensate me


AI: It's disappointing when a company apologizes but doesn't take adequate action to make things right.


In this case, since Concu has already apologized but failed to compensate you, you may want to consider taking further action to seek a resolution. One option is to send a legal notice to Concu, detailing the incident, the relief you're seeking, and a deadline for them to respond and compensate you.


If you're not comfortable sending a legal notice yourself, I can help you draft a sample notice. Alternatively, you can also consider filing a complaint with the local consumer forum or district consumer dispute redressal forum in your area.

* Jurisdiction: SCDRC has jurisdiction over cases where the value of the goods or services and the compensation claimed exceeds ₹1 crore but does not exceed ₹10 crores.
* Recommended for: Cases where the value of the dispute is high and requires a more formal and structured approach.


**DCDRF (District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum)**


* Jurisdiction: DCDRF has jurisdiction over cases where the value of the goods or services and the compensation claimed does not exceed ₹1 crore.
* Recommended for: Cases where the value of the dispute is relatively low and requires a more informal and speedy approach.


**e-daakhil**


* Jurisdiction: e-daakhil is a centralized portal for filing consumer complaints, and it can be used for cases of any value.
* Recommended for: Cases where you want to file a complaint online and track the status of your case easily.


Considering your case, since the amount charged by Lenovo's customer care is ₹ [Amount Charged], which is less than ₹1 crore, I would recommend filing a complaint with the **DCDRF** in your district. This will be a more informal and speedy approach, and you can also use the e-daakhil portal to file the complaint and track the status.


However, if you prefer a more formal and structured approach, you can also file a complaint with the **SCDRC** in your state.


Please note that you can also file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for assistance and guidance.

Human: Should I use DCDRF or Edaakhil? Are both the same?


AI: While both DCDRF and e-daakhil are related to consumer complaints, they serve different purposes and have different functions.


**DCDRF (District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum)**


* A quasi-judicial body that resolves consumer disputes at the district level.
* Deals with complaints against traders, manufacturers, and service providers.
* Has jurisdiction over cases where the value of the goods or services and the compensation claimed does not exceed ₹1 crore.
* Provides a more formal and structured approach to resolving disputes.


**e-daakhil**


* A centralized portal for filing consumer complaints.
* Allows consumers to file complaints online and track the status of their cases.
* Provides a unique complaint number and facilitates communication between the consumer and the opposite party.
* Can be used to file complaints with any consumer forum, including DCDRF, SCDRC, and NCDRC.

AI: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I'd like to help you resolve this issue. 


Can you please tell me more about what led to this issue? Did you return the modem and request to cancel your service, but the company is still sending you bills?


Human: I got my wifi from Jio. When i had to move houses, they told me that if i dont pay the bill for two months the plan will automatically get disabled. I got the call saying my plan is disabled, but i still have bogus dues on my account and keep getting spam calls for the same


AI: It sounds like you're experiencing a billing issue with Jio after moving houses and your plan being disabled.

If you're not satisfied with their response, we can explore further options, including filing a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) or the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).

Human: I found a dead snail in my ginger beer. What do i do?


AI: That's quite disturbing. I'd be happy to help you with this issue. Can you please tell me more about what happened? How did you discover the snail, and have you already contacted the manufacturer or the store where you purchased the ginger beer?


Human: It was an unopened bottle at a restaurant. I dont know if i should sue the restaurant or the manufacturer


AI: That's a good point about the unopened bottle. Since it was purchased at a restaurant, they might be liable for serving a defective product. However, it's also possible that the manufacturer could be responsible for the contamination.


To proceed, can you please tell me if you have any documentation or evidence of the incident, such as a photo of the snail in the bottle or a receipt from the restaurant?


Human: I have the reciept as well as a picture of the snail


AI: Having evidence like that can be helpful in case you decide to take further action. 


Considering this is a food safety issue, I would recommend contacting the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) or the local health department in your area. They can guide you on the next steps and help ensure that the restaurant and manufacturer take necessary actions to prevent such incidents in the future.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the FSSAI through their Food Safety Connect Portal: https://foscos.fssai.gov.in/consumer-grievance/. They can also provide you with a special concern number that you can use to track the progress of your complaint.


Would you like me to guide you through the process of filing a complaint with FSSAI or would you like to contact them directly?


Human: How do I file a complaint through the Food Safety Connect Portal?


AI: Filing a complaint through the Food Safety Connect Portal is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide:


1. Visit the FSSAI website: https://foscos.fssai.gov.in/
2. Click on the ""Consumer Grievance"" tab.
3. Fill out the complaint form with the required details, including your name, contact information, and a brief description of the incident.
4. Attach the photo of the snail and the receipt as evidence.
5. Choose the category of complaint (in this case, ""Food Safety"") and select the state where the incident occurred.
6. Submit the complaint.
7. You will receive a unique complaint reference number via SMS on your registered mobile number.
8. You can use this reference number to track the status of your complaint online or by contacting the FSSAI through their helpline.


Additionally, you can also register a complaint through the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal: https://pgportal.gov.in/. This is an online platform available 24/7 to lodge grievances to public authorities on any subject.


If you need assistance with filing the complaint or have any questions, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help.


Would you like me to provide you with the contact details of the local FSSAI office or the state food authority in case you need to follow up on your complaint?


Human: I bought the ginger beer in United Kingdom. I am from Kerala


AI: Since the incident occurred in the UK and you're from Kerala, India, we'll need to consider the laws and regulations of both countries. 


In this case, you can file a complaint with the UK's local authorities, such as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) or the local council's environmental health department. They will investigate the matter and take necessary actions against the restaurant and the manufacturer.


Additionally, you can also file a complaint with the FSSAI, as the product was sold in India, and they can take action against the manufacturer if they have a presence in India.


However, since you're in India, you can also contact the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for assistance. They can guide you on the next steps and provide information on the laws and regulations related to consumer protection in India.


Would you like me to provide you with the contact details of the FSA or the local council's environmental health department in the UK, or the FSSAI in India?


Human: no thank you!


AI: It was my pleasure to assist you with your consumer grievance. If you have any other issues or need further assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.


Before we part ways, I would like to remind you that you can also file a complaint online at the e-daakhil portal: http://edaakhil.nic.in/. This is a government portal that allows you to file complaints related to consumer grievances.

Human: I bought a lipstick and it gave me rashes 


AI: Sorry to hear that you experienced rashes after using the lipstick. Thank you for sharing this with me. Can you please tell me more about what happened? What led to the rashes - was it an allergic reaction, or was there something else that you think caused it?


Human: It seems like it was an allergic reaction but there was no listed allergen


AI: It's concerning that the lipstick didn't have any listed allergens, and you experienced an allergic reaction. Did you purchase the lipstick from a physical store or an e-commerce website?


Human: it was from a physical store


AI: You can try returning the product to the store where you purchased it and ask for a refund or a replacement. If they're unable to assist you, you can also approach the drug controller of the concerned state. In India, you can file a complaint with the State Drugs Control Office. You can find the contact information on the website: https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/State-Drugs-Control/. 


Additionally, you can also consider registering a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take. Would you like me to provide you with the location-based helpline number for your state as well?


Human: How do I file a complaint with the state drugs control office? My state is Uttar Pradesh.


AI: To file a complaint with the State Drugs Control Office in Uttar Pradesh, you can follow these steps:


1. First, you can try contacting the manufacturing company of the lipstick and report the issue to them. If they're unable to assist you, you can proceed to the next step.
2. You can approach the State Drugs Control Office in Uttar Pradesh. You can find their contact information on the website: https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/State-Drugs-Control/. 
3. You can also contact the State Drugs Helpdesk at helpdesk.statedrug@cdsco.nic.in.
4. If you're not satisfied with the response from the State Drugs Control Office, you can escalate the issue to the Drug Controller General of India: https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/About-us/who/.
5. You can also register a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance. They can guide you on the next steps to take.


Before filing a complaint, make sure to have the following details ready: 
- The name and address of the manufacturing company
- The name and batch number of the lipstick
- A detailed description of the issue you faced (allergic reaction, rashes, etc.)
- Any relevant medical documents or photographs of the affected area


If you need any further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask.


Is there anything else I can help you with?


Human: Would it be better to file the complaint before the State Drugs Control Office or the National Consumer Helpline?


AI: It's not necessarily a question of which one to file the complaint with first, but rather where to start. Since your issue is related to a product (lipstick) that caused an allergic reaction, you can consider starting with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000). They can provide you with guidance on the next steps to take and may be able to assist you in filing a complaint with the State Drugs Control Office or the manufacturer.


The National Consumer Helpline can help you navigate the process and ensure that your complaint is handled properly. They may also be able to provide you with a reference number or a case number, which you can use to follow up on your complaint.


After speaking with the National Consumer Helpline, you can then approach the State Drugs Control Office in Uttar Pradesh to file a complaint. They can investigate the matter and take necessary actions against the manufacturer.


Keep in mind that the National Consumer Helpline is a one-stop-shop for consumer complaints, and they can guide you through the entire process. Would you like me to provide you with the contact details for the National Consumer Helpline again?


Human: No thank you. What is the compensation amount that I can expect from this?


AI: Compensation amounts can vary depending on the severity of the issue and the circumstances. In India, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides for compensation to consumers who have suffered losses due to defective or hazardous products.


In cases of allergic reactions caused by a product, the compensation amount can be substantial. However, it's difficult to estimate the exact amount without knowing the specifics of your case.


Under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCRF) can order the manufacturer to pay compensation to the consumer for:


* Actual damages suffered by the consumer
* Interest on the damages at a rate not exceeding 18% per annum
* Cost of litigation
* Other reasonable expenses incurred by the consumer


The maximum compensation amount that can be awarded by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) is Rs. 10 crores.


In your case, since you've experienced an allergic reaction due to the lipstick, you may be eligible for compensation for the damages suffered, including medical expenses, lost wages, and other related costs.


Keep in mind that the actual compensation amount will depend on the facts of your case and the decision of the forum or commission that hears your complaint. It's best to consult with a consumer rights lawyer or seek guidance from the National Consumer Helpline to understand your options and the potential compensation you may be eligible for.


Human: Thank you!


AI: It was my pleasure to assist you with your consumer grievance. I hope you get a resolution to your issue and the compensation you deserve. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Remember to also register your complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (1800-11-4000) for immediate assistance.
