0," The bank has increased my EMI and modified the tenure of my loan without prior notice? Do I have a remedy? 
","Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
"
1," I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of Cenza Bank Private Limited located in the city of Cosmos on 04/02/2022 at 10:30 am for information regarding auto loans. On 06/02/2022, the bank sanctioned a loan amount of Rs 10,00,000/- for the purchase of a car. 
","Is there anything else that you would like to add?
"
2," Details regarding the EMI were sent via SMS, and as per the message sent, I was supposed to pay Rs 25,000 per month for the time period of  50 months beginning March 2022. However, at the time of the first EMI payment, I received an email which stated that I would have to pay Rs 30,000 per month for the period of 40 months beginning March 2022. 
","When was the loan agreement entered into? 
"
3," On 08/06/2022, and the hire-purchase agreement was also signed on 10/06/2022 
","What kind of interest rate did you opt for? 
"
4," Fixed 
","What does the loan agreement state in terms of the EMI to be paid? Does it have clauses that subject it to periodic revision? 
"
5," As per the loan agreement, it was Rs 5,000 per month  for the time period of 24 months. The only caveat was that it could be modified under special circumstances. 
","Were you informed of any special circumstances that merited changes in the interest rate? 
"
6," No 
</s> <s><INST> Also, the financier promised to make the necessary changes in RC book and insurance policy but hasn’t done it yet. 
","Okay. With respect to the EMI payments, it is to be noted that between the SMS received and the loan agreement, the latter would have an overriding effect, so if the EMI notification received in March 2022 is not as per the loan agreement, you may be able to raise a valid grievance. 
</INST> With respect to the name changes in the RC book and insurance policy for a vehicle purchased under a hire-purchase agreement, it might help to take note of the fact that applications for name changes have to be initiated not by the financier alone, but along with the owner of the vehicle or any authorized agent. 
Please refer to Chapter III of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. 
</INST> Have you authorized the financier to file an application on your behalf? 
"
7," No
","Then, I am afraid you may not be able to claim relief for the delay in name transfer. 
"
8," Also, I work as a driver so I purchased the vehicle for not just personal use. Will I still be able to claim relief under the consumer protection act?  
","Thanks for the question. You will be able to approach the consumer protection forum as you purchased the vehicle in furtherance of your livelihood. 
Please refer to section 2(7) of the 2019 Consumer Protection Act for more information. 
Hope that answers your query. 
"
9," Okay. How do I proceed to obtain compensation in respect of the EMI issue? 
","If the bank has not been responsive to your requests, you can approach the banking ombudsman. 
For more information, log on to https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/Complaints.aspx 
</INST> Alternatively, you can approach the consumer dispute redressal forum for deficiency in service 
"
10," I would like to approach the consumer protection forum 
","Okay, before that, have you considered sending them a notice? 
"
11," Yes, I sent them a notice dated 15/04/2022, but I have not received any reply from them yet
","Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum?

","I'm sorry to hear that. Can you provide more details about how you were deceived by the service centre and for which bike?
"
19," I have a Yamaha Fascino Vehicle, Model no.125 FI hybrid, bearing no. TN-58-AP-7864. I gave it to the authorised service centre at Kochadai, Madurai. I had applied for an “annual maintenance contract”. As per the annual contract I was given 3 free services without any labour charge and 2 free wash. But when I approached the service centre after using 2 free services and one free wash, the third service was supposed to be free but they charged me Rs. 460 for the service instead of giving free service. 
</INST>. Please give additional information, so that I can understand the full timeline of events. What is the name and the address of the service centre where you gave your bike for service?

"
20,": I purchased the annual maintenance contract on January 4, 2021. For a payment of Rs 999, I was supposed to get 3 free services without any labour charges and 2 free water washes. 
","Okay, and on that same initial visit on January 4, did you receive any documentation for the Annual Maintenance purchase and the first free service? Did you avail any free service from the service centre.
"
21,"Yes, they gave me a receipt for the AMC payment of Rs 999 (Bill #GES8826) and a job card for the first free service (Job Card #60183A). The first service invoice also mentioned the next service would be due on March 4.Yes, I have availed 2 free services but when I went for the 3rd free service the service centre denied me the last free service and charged me labour fees.
</INST>:Great, those receipts will be useful evidence. And when did you go in for the second free service under the AMC?: 
</s> <s><INST> I went in on May 4 for the second service. 
","Understood. It seems up until that point, everything was going smoothly under the contract. When did things go wrong?

"

"
47," Hi! I bought a Maruti Suzuki Swift VDI car about three years ago, and I've been having a problem with one of the doors. It got damaged due to rust within the first 13 months, and the company is not willing to repair or replace it.

","Can you please provide your full name, age, occupation, and residential address?

"
48," Sure, my name is Sheik Jaffar, I'm 35 years old, I run a small business, and I live at H.No.3-60, Siddapur village, Kothur Mandal, R.R. District – 509338.

","Let's discuss the specifics of the purchase. When did you buy the Swift VDI car, and from which dealership did you make the purchase? What problem did you face with the purchased car?What did you do to redress the issue?

"
49," I purchased the car for Rs 7,25,000 on July 18, 2018, from Sri Jayaram Motors Pvt. Ltd., located at Plot Nos. C1 and C2, Industrial Area, Mettugadda, Mahabubnagar - 509001. I first noticed the issue with the car door within the first 13 months of purchase, and I approached the dealer, Sri Jayaram Motors, multiple times regarding the problem from the date of purchase ie. July 18,2018. However, they refused to repair or replace the damaged door. The damage was due to rust, and it affected both the cosmetic appearance and the functionality of the door. I spent Rs. 1,00,000/- that  includes the expenses I had to incur for repairing the damaged door  in August 2019. 

","When you gave your car for repairs, the person who repaired your car might have informed you about the shortcoming in the design and material used in the manufacturing of the car door that caused the damage to the car door within a short amount of time.

"
50," The worker, where I repaired my car, informed me that the use of the galvanised steel is known for its resistance to corrosion, and using it in car bodies can significantly extend the durability of the vehicle. In my case, the rusting of the car door occurred within a relatively short period, indicating a lack of adequate corrosion resistance in the materials used. Despite the company's claim in the owner's manual about the state-of-the-art technology and periodic servicing for optimal results, they failed to address the issue, leading to continued frustration on my part.

","Thank you for sharing that information. Now, let's discuss the evidence you have to support your complaint.?

"
51," The invoice serves as proof of the purchase of the Swift VDI car. I have a copy of Service records and job cards establishing my multiple attempts to seek assistance from authorised workshops. Photographs of the damaged door are crucial visual evidence that showcases the extent of the rusting and the need for repairs or replacement.

","Thank you for providing clarity on the evidence.You have the option to send a legal notice or file a complaint. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

"
52," Thank you for sharing the helpline number. Kindly draft me a legal notice. 

","You have already mentioned the address of the opposite party from where you made the purchase but I advise you to make Maruti Suzuki also the party to the case. So kindly provide the address of the opposite party Maruti Suzuki.

"
53," The address of the opposite party is  Maruti Suzuki India Limited, Rep. by its Executive Vice President (Service), Palam Gurgaon Road, Gurgaon - 122 015.


","Here is  the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party. But it is to inform you that the opposite party may not agree to the demand that you made in the notice. In such a case you should file a consumer complaint.
"
54," Please, tell me the process to file  the consumer complaint. I would like to file a complaint
","Before filing the consumer complaint, you have to consider in what jurisdiction you are going to file the complaint. Now, considering the jurisdiction, You reside in Rangareddi District and the opposite party resides in Mahabubnagar district. Therefore, I believe both the courts have authority to try and entertain my complaint. Which court do you prefer?

"
55," I prefer Mahabubnagar court. Please draft the consumer complaint. 

","I will draft a complaint for you but before that I would like to have your input as to what redressal do you seek from the consumer court, you can  ask for replacement of the door or compensation for deficiency of service and the cost for the complaint. 

"
56," I would like to ask for the compensation of Rs 1,00,000. The amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- is based on the actual expenses incurred for repairing the damaged door in Aug 2019. I would like to have Rs. 9,15,000/- as for the deficiency in service and hardship I endured. 

","Thank you for providing detailed information, Sheik Jaffar. I believe we have covered all the relevant aspects of your case. Is there anything else you would like to add or clarify before we conclude our conversation?

"
57," I believe we've covered everything. I just hope that this process can lead to a fair resolution and compensation for the troubles I've faced with my car.

","Thank you. The evidence would help us shield our case. On the basis of the documents that you have given me, I have drafted a pre-filled complaint that you can access here. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?
"
58," Yes, it will be great if you can do that as well.
","You can access the Affidavit here and the Memorandum of Parties here. You are required to fill in the details that have been left empty in both the documents.

"
109," Hi, I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding an issue I'm facing with a finance company.
","Could you please explain the complete details about your issue?

"
110," Okay, here is the background - My name is Syed Sidiq Pasha and I am an auto driver residing in Mahabubnagar. In November 2016, I purchased an auto rickshaw bearing registration number TS 06 UB 3143 from a dealer named Samskruthi Automobiles.

","</INST> What problem did you face ?

"
111," This auto was originally purchased by another person named Varanasi Ashanna. He had obtained finance from a company called Fortune Integrated Assets Finance Ltd to buy the auto on loan. Ashanna could not pay the monthly instalments for the loan regularly. So Fortune Integrated seized the auto from him. That's when Samskruthi Automobiles, who is an agent for Fortune Integrated, sold the seized auto to me in November 2016 and according to the terms of agreement I would pay the remaining loan instalments to Fortune Integrated in monthly payments.

","Understood. Please provide more details about the terms of payment for purchasing this pre-used auto from Samskruthi Automobiles.

"
112," As per the agreement, I had to pay Fortune Integrated the balance loan amount in 30 monthly instalments of Rs. 5,800 each. I paid 4 instalments upfront at the time of purchase in November 2016.I paid them regularly the remaining instalment for over 2 years.

","Great. Please confirm how many instalments you paid in total before any issue arose?

"
113," I paid 27 instalments promptly till March 2019, paying almost Rs. 1,56,600. Then I approached Samskruthi Automobiles requesting them to accept the remaining 3 instalments in full so I could get the auto registration transferred to my name.But Samskruthi Automobiles started behaving strangely at that time. They said they had misplaced my agreement and kept delaying and postponing the matter whenever I approached them.

","Did you follow up with them again after this?

"
114," Yes, I followed up with them continuously after that for almost 1 year but they kept stalling. And then in February 2020, they seized my auto arbitrarily without any prior notice.Then they started demanding additional ₹78,874 for releasing my auto despite having already received ₹1,56,600 from me.

","Did they explain why they were demanding this additional amount?

"
115," They gave some vague reasons that I had pending instalments and interest due. But it was all lies to try and extract more money from me. I had already paid as per the original agreement terms.

","In that case we should send a legal notice to the opposite party. May I draft a legal notice for you.

"
116," Yes, Kindly draft the notice. 

","Kindly note, in order to draft the legal notice, I will need your proper address and the address of the opposite party.

"
117," My address is Syed Sidiq Pasha, S/o Syed Yousuf, Aged 52 years, Occ: Auto Driver, R/o H.No.4-2-16/6, Ramaiah Bowli, Mahabubnagar town & district and the opposite party address is The Authorised Signatory, Samskruthi Automobiles, RSP with: Fortune Integrated Assets Finance Ltd., #5-85/20A, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar town. 


","Here is the draft notice. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. .In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you to call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?
 Do you also need me to draft the complaint? 

"
118," I have already approached them so many times I do not think notice will have any impact on the conduct of the opposite party. Please go ahead and draft the initial complaint. I'll review it and provide my inputs.

","Could you please tell what relief you expect from the court, do you want your vehicle back or do you need your money as compensation for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party. This will help me to specify the remedy in the complaint.

"
119," I want my vehicle back and some compensation for the loss I have suffered due to arbitrary seized possession of my vehicle.

","Thanks for sharing the address. With respect to the jurisdiction, the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar will have jurisdiction as both the parties have residence and office at Mahabubnagar. I hope this works for you. 

"
120," Yes, the jurisdiction of District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar would work fine for me.  

","Sure, I'll draft the initial version of the consumer complaint for your review covering all the details we discussed today. Please share any supporting documents that you may have regarding your purchase, payments made, seizure notice etc. along with a copy of your agreement. This will help me represent the facts better.

121," I have uploaded the documents here.

Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?

140," Hi. I want to file a complaint against a two-wheeler dealership regarding an issue I faced during purchase of a new vehicle.
","Okay. I can help you with filing a consumer complaint. But first, let me understand the full details of your case. Could you please provide me some basic information like your name, age, address etc?
"
141," Sure. My name is Sura Dasharatha and I am 35 years old. I reside at House Number 3-138, Peddamandadi Village, Peddamandadi Mandal, Wanaparthy District, Telangana - 509103.
","Thank you for providing the details. Now, please explain what the complaint is about and what happened exactly?
"
142," So I purchased a new two-wheeler - a Honda CD 110 from a dealership named Narmada Honda located at Polytechnic Road, Wanaparthy. The authorized dealer's name is Bondili Venugopal Singh. On 15th November 2020, I paid Rs. 30,000 as downpayment and opted for financing the remaining amount from a bank.
","Okay. Please provide me the full address of the dealership and the name of the authorized dealer against whom you want to file the complaint.
"
143," The dealership address is - Narmada Honda, #44-24/19, 20, 21, Raja Rameshwar Rao Complex, Polytechnic Road, Wanaparthy, Telangana - 509103. And the authorized dealer is Mr. Bondili Venugopal Singh, son of Bondili Madan Mohan Singh.
","Noted. You can proceed to explain the issue you faced.
"
144," At the time of purchasing the two-wheeler, the dealer offered a Diwali gift hamper of a LED TV worth Rs. 13,999. This offer was part of their festive promotion and was advertised through pamphlets. On the day of delivery of my vehicle, they provided a LED TV worth only Rs. 6,000 instead of the promised Rs. 13,999 LED TV.
","Okay. So they had advertised an offer but did not fulfill it properly during delivery. Did you speak to them about this at that time?
"
145," Yes, when they gave me the Rs. 6,000 LED TV, I immediately informed that this is not as per the promised offer. I requested them to provide the LED TV worth Rs. 13,999 as advertised. But they refused. I made many requests later on also, but they did not agree to give the correct LED TV per the offer.
","Hmm...I understand this must have been very disappointing and caused you inconvenience. What was their response when you requested them to honor the original offer?
"
146," They simply denied my request and said they can't provide the higher value LED TV. No proper explanation was given in spite of my multiple requests through phone calls and personal visits.
","Did you make the requests to them in writing via email or letter?
"
147," No, I did not write to them formally but I have proof of the offer they made in the pamphlet and the lower value LED TV bill which clearly shows their deficiency in service.
","Okay thanks for explaining it clearly. Just a couple more questions - when exactly did you purchase the two-wheeler and when did you get delivery? Also, do you have the purchase invoice and any other documents related to this transaction?
"
148," I purchased the two-wheeler on 15th November 2020 and took delivery also on the same date. Yes I have the original purchase invoice, the booking form copy and a copy of the promotional Diwali offer pamphlet given by the dealership. I can provide you copies of these documents.
","That would be very helpful. Please provide me scanned copies of the invoice, booking form/receipt, promotional pamphlet and any other proofs related to this purchase. These documents will support your complaint.
"
149," Sure, I will send you soft copies of all the documents by email. I also have the original hard copies if required later.
","Wonderful. This is very good documentation to prove your case. Just a couple more questions - have you filed any formal complaints against the dealership before approaching me? If yes, please provide details.
"
150," No I have not filed any formal complaint against them anywhere yet. You are the first one I am approaching for help to resolve this issue.
","Okay thanks for clarifying. Last question - how much compensation or relief amount are you seeking from the dealership through your complaint?
"
151," I want them to provide the LED TV worth Rs. 13,999 as per their promotional offer. I do not have any specific compensation amount in mind, but I believe I should be reimbursed for the mental agony and harassment caused by their unfair trade practice. I also want to be compensated for the costs involved in filing this complaint.
","Duly noted. Thank you Mr. Sura for providing all the details clearly. I now have a good understanding of your grievance and the issue. I will draft a consumer complaint on your behalf highlighting all these points and also suggesting appropriate compensation and relief amounts. I will send it to you for review before we proceed to file it with the consumer court. Do let me know if you need any other assistance.

156," Hi Chatbot, I purchased a water purifier online last year which has been giving me trouble since day 1. 

","I understand, let's take this step-by-step so I can gather all the details. Could you start by providing your name, age, occupation and location details?

"
157," Sure, my name is Gouni Consumer Reddy, I'm 20 years old and currently a student. I reside at House no. 16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur Mandal in Wanaparthy District.

","Thank you for the introduction Mr. Gouni Consumer Reddy. Can you now explain the purchasing details as to the water purifier you had purchased?
"
158," I purchased an Aquasure Delight RO+UV+MTDS water purifier made by Eureka Forbes Limited. I bought it online through Amazon India on 6th August 2020 for the amount of Rs. 8,990/-. There was a delay in installation due to Covid restrictions at that time. The installation happened only on 25th August 2020, almost 20 days after delivery. But as soon as it was installed I noticed there was some leakage happening from the purifier. I complained about this defect on the same day, 25th August 2020.

","What response did you get from the company when you first complained about this leakage?

"
159," I called their customer care multiple times but there was no proper response. After continuously following up for 10 days, a service technician finally came after a month and was able to fix the leakage temporarily. The issues continued. While the leakage was fixed, now the purifier started taking too much time to purify water and also started wasting a lot of water during the process. I again started calling the Eureka Forbes customer care regularly to complain. They would assure me everytime that they were sending a technician within 24 hours, but no one would turn up for weeks.After waiting for a month, the technician came and said I need to install an additional filter in the purifier, which would cost me Rs. 380 extra. I had no choice but to agree and get it installed.

</INST>. Did installing this extra filter solve all the water purifier problems?

</s> <s><INST> No, even after installing the additional filter, I continued to face problems frequently. I had to call them multiple times again for the same issues. Then another technician came after a month and said the RO membrane had to be replaced. There was some improvement after the membrane was changed. But after about 1 week, the purifier stopped working again. Each time it would work only for a few days and then break down again.

","Very frustrating experience you have had. After all these issues, what did the company technicians finally say? 

"
160," Technician was of the opinion that it is better to go for replacement of the product. Based on this I asked for the refund or replacement but the company said that the water purifier can not be replaced or returned only within 30 days of purchase as per the company’s terms and conditions. After this I registered a grievance on the consumer helpline website on 15-04-2021, vide No.2679203, after 3 months, I got a mail stating that “intimated customer as per policy can not refund or replace the unit after purchase of 10 months”.

","See the machine was not working since day one and there have been multiple attempts to approach the opposite party. I would also recommend you send the legal notice to the opposite party.

"
161," Yes, please draft the notice and ask for the replacement of the water purifier. 

","I would draft the complaint and the notice. But for this I need some additional information, like the name of the parties, your name and the name and address of the opposite party. Kindly noted that we will have 2 opposite parties, Eureka Forbes Ltd and Amazon India. 

"
162," You can mention my address as Gouni Sai Charan Reddy, S/o Gouni Harshavardhan Reddy, aged 20 years, Occ: Student, R/o H.No.16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur mandal, Wanaparthy District.

The Authorised Signatory, Amazon India, Brigade Gateway, 8th Floor, 26/1, Dr. Rajkumar Road, Malleshwaram (W), Bangalore - 560055, Karnataka.

","Could you please tell what relief you expect, for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party. 

"
163," I would like  to get a water purifier of  the same model or return costs of the water purifier along with interest and to Rs.20,000/- towards compensation for adopting unfair trade practice, mental agony and deficiency of service and Rs.10,000/- towards costs of the complaint to the complainant.

","Here is the notice that you can send to both the opposite parties.

172," My Samsung LED TV broke in the checked- in baggage at the airport.

","Okay Mr. Murugesan, before we begin discussing the specifics of your case, I'd like to get some background information. What do you do for a living? This helps provide context when drafting the complaint.

"
173," I'm a professional cricket player and represent the Tamil Nadu Ranji cricket team in domestic tournaments. 

","Can you please explain to me, in your own words, what is the complaint about?

"
174," On January 29, 2017 I was returning from Saudi Arabia to Trichy, India via a connecting flight in Mumbai. When I landed in Mumbai around 6am and went to collect my checked-in baggage for the connecting flight, I found my suitcase was damaged and open. To my shock, the Samsung LED TV I had carefully packed in the baggage was completely smashed and broken. 

","Can you please tell me, what did you do after discovering the damage? 

"
175," Well, after seeing the damage, I immediately approached the Jet Airways staff present in the baggage area in Mumbai. I reported the damage to them. The staff gave me a baggage damage report with the file number BOM9W55305 as proof of my complaint. They assured me they would investigate and resolve the matter and that I would be compensated with either a new TV or equivalent cash when I reached Trichy. 

","what happened when you arrived in Trichy - were you provided any compensation as assured?

"
176," No, unfortunately not. When I reached Trichy airport, Jet Airways did not provide any replacement TV or cash compensation, even though they had promised to do so in Mumbai. 

","Apologies you had to face that additional stress. Can you please tell me if you followed up with Jet Airways subsequently regarding compensation? 

"
177," Yes, I did follow up multiple times. On February 10, 2017 I emailed Jet Airways customer care informing them about the baggage damage and lack of compensation. They responded saying they would address my query in 24 hours, but never did. After waiting patiently for over 2 months, I sent Jet Airways a legal notice on April 3, 2017 demanding compensation. 

","Did Jet Airways respond to your legal notice and offer a resolution?

"
178," They sent a very late reply to my notice on May 5, 2017. In their reply they asked for documents like my ticket and boarding pass which I had already provided earlier.

","I appreciate you sharing all those details. Just to confirm, do you have copies of the supporting documents like damage report, legal notice, Jet Airways' reply etc which can be attached as evidence to the complaint?

"
179," Yes, I have all the relevant documents and can provide copies - the damage report, TV cash memo, flight and excess baggage tickets, email correspondence, legal notice and Jet's reply. I can share these as exhibits to support the complaint.

","That is very helpful. Those documents will strengthen your case. A few more questions - what compensation amount are you seeking through the consumer complaint?

"
180," I would like to seek Rs. 50,000 as compensation for the damaged TV, Rs. 30,000 for mental harassment, Rs. 10,000 for deficiency in service and Rs. 10,000 as litigation charges.

","Got it. And lastly, can you please confirm your full residential address for the complaint drafting? Also, which consumer court do you want to file the complaint in, based on whose jurisdiction?

"
181," My full address is - M. Murugesan, S/o Muniyandi, D.No.4/150, Ayyanarpuram, Chinthamani Road, Madurai District. 

","As you reside in Madurai, the consumer complaint can be filed in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Madurai, you can also file it in Trichy and Mumbai where the opposite party office is located. Where would you like to file the complaint?

"
182," I would like to file a complaint in Madurai.

190," The incident happened on 19th February 2021. My husband Jalakanti Madhu used to go for agricultural soil digging and transport work on his tractorOn 19th February evening around 5:30pm, my husband Madhu was digging and loading soil on the tractor at Bhakoni Thippa. During this work, the tractor accidentally slipped and fell over him. He came under the tractor and died on the spot due to the accident. We informed the local Pangal police station about the incident. They registered an FIR under section 304A IPC and did the inquest,  postmortem and other procedural formalities. 
","Can you specify the details of the insurance policy, like policy number, validity period, accidental cover and with whom were you insured?

"
191," My husband had taken an insurance policy from ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The policy number is 3008/195832894/00 which was valid from 3rd March 2020 to 2nd March 2021. It included a personal accident cover of ₹15 lakhs for the owner-driver of the tractor. 

","what step did you take once you realised that the accident was covered under insurance?
"
192," Immediately after the incident I informed ICICI Lombard by calling them and also submitted the claim forms. I followed up continuously after that also. The company kept delaying and did not settle the claim. Initially on 15th June 2022 they replied that the claim will be processed but after that no response even after multiple follow-ups. It has been over a year now but I'm yet to receive any claim settlement.

","That is concerning. You can send a legal notice to the ICICI Lombard. May I draft a legal notice  for you?

"
222," Hi! I bought a Maruti Suzuki Swift VDI car about three years ago, and I've been having a problem with one of the doors. It got damaged due to rust within the first 13 months, and the company is not willing to repair or replace it.

","Can you please provide your full name, age, occupation, and residential address?

"
223," Sure, my name is Sheik Jaffar, I'm 35 years old, I run a small business, and I live at H.No.3-60, Siddapur village, Kothur Mandal, R.R. District – 509338.

","Let's discuss the specifics of the purchase. When did you buy the Swift VDI car, and from which dealership did you make the purchase? What problem did you face with the purchased car?What did you do to redress the issue?

"
224," I purchased the car for Rs 7,25,000 on July 18, 2018, from Sri Jayaram Motors Pvt. Ltd., located at Plot Nos. C1 and C2, Industrial Area, Mettugadda, Mahabubnagar - 509001. I first noticed the issue with the car door within the first 13 months of purchase, and I approached the dealer, Sri Jayaram Motors, multiple times regarding the problem from the date of purchase ie. July 18,2018. However, they refused to repair or replace the damaged door. The damage was due to rust, and it affected both the cosmetic appearance and the functionality of the door. I spent Rs. 1,00,000/- that  includes the expenses I had to incur for repairing the damaged door  in Aug 2019. 

","When  you repaired the car door. The one who repaired your car might have informed you about the shortcoming in the design and material used in the manufacturing of the car door that caused the damage to the car door within a short amount of time.

"
225," The worker, where I repaired my car, informed me that the use of the galvanised steel is known for its resistance to corrosion, and using it in car bodies can significantly extend the durability of the vehicle. In my case, the rusting of the car door occurred within a relatively short period, indicating a lack of adequate corrosion resistance in the materials used. Despite the company's claim in the owner's manual about the state-of-the-art technology and periodic servicing for optimal results, they failed to address the issue, leading to continued frustration on my part.

","Thank you for sharing that information. Now, let's discuss the evidence you have to support your complaint.?

"
226," The invoice serves as proof of the purchase of the Swift VDI car. I have a copy of Service records and job cards establishing my multiple attempts to seek assistance from authorised workshops. Photographs of the damaged door are crucial visual evidence that showcases the extent of the rusting and the need for repairs or replacement.

","Thank you for providing clarity on the evidence.You have the option to send a legal notice or file a complaint. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

"
227," Thank you for sharing the helpline number. Kindly draft me a legal notice. 

","Here is  the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party. But it is to inform you that the opposite party may not agree to the demand that you made in the notice. In such a case you should file a consumer complaint.
"
228," Please, tell me the process to file  the consumer complaint. I would like to file a complaint
","Before filing the consumer complaint, you have to consider in what jurisdiction you are going to file the complaint. Now, considering the jurisdiction, You reside in Rangareddi District and the opposite party resides in Mahabubnagar district. Therefore, I believe both the courts have authority to try and entertain my complaint. Which court do you prefer?

"
229," I prefer Mahabubnagar court. Please draft the consumer complaint. 

","I will draft a complaint for you but before that I would like to have your input as to what redressal do you seek from the consumer court, you can  ask for replacement of the door or compensation for deficiency of service and the cost for the complaint. 

"
230," I would like to ask for the compensation of Rs 1,00,000. The amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- is based on the actual expenses incurred for repairing the damaged door in Aug 2019. I would like to have Rs. 9,15,000/- as for the deficiency in service and hardship I endured. 

","Thank you for providing detailed information, Sheik Jaffar. I believe we have covered all the relevant aspects of your case. Is there anything else you would like to add or clarify before we conclude our conversation?

"
231," I believe we've covered everything. I just hope that this process can lead to a fair resolution and compensation for the troubles I've faced with my car.

","I understand your concerns, Sheik Jaffar. Please provide clarity about all the documents that you have regarding the case like the  copy of invoice dated 18.07.2018 for purchase of Swift VDI car, copies of service records/job cards evidencing visits to authorised workshops, photographs of the car showing rusting/damage to the door. This will help me draft a complaint.

"
232," I have all the documents that you just mentioned. 

","Thank you. The evidence would help us shield our case. On the basis of the documents that you have given me, I have drafted a pre-filled complaint that you can access here. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?

233," Yes, it will be great if you can do that as well.

"
237," Hi . I need help with filing a consumer complaint against a chit fund operator who has not paid me my due amount. 

","Okay, Could you please start by telling me your name and some basic details about yourself?

"
238," Sure. My name is A. Balavardhan Reddy, son of A. Ram Reddy. I am 35 years old and work as a private employee. I reside at House Number 1-21, Yellareddypalle village, Koilkonda mandal, Mahabubnagar district.

","Thank you for providing those details Mr. Balavardhan Reddy. Now, can you please explain to me in detail  about the chit fund issue you are facing? 

"
239," The chit fund operator is an individual named S. Govardhan Reddy, son of Narayan Reddy. He is around 53 years old and runs this business in Mahabubnagar district. He currently resides in Hyderabad after shifting from his native place. Actually, Govardhan Reddy and I are distant relatives. When he started this chit fund scheme in Mahabubnagar in 2015, he approached me and requested that I join as a chit member since he knew me. It is an unregistered chit fund operation.

","What was the total chit value you opted for and what were the terms regarding duration, instalments, commission etc?

"
240," I joined the chit fund in October 2015 when it commenced. The total chit value I opted for was Rs 5,00,000. It was scheduled to run for 25 months, so my monthly subscription amount was Rs 20,000. As per the terms, 5% commission would be deducted from the chit amount. 

","Were any written documents or agreements executed between you and Mr. Govardhan Reddy regarding this chit fund? 

"
241," No, nothing in writing was made. Everything was on trust and verbal agreement since we knew each other. But he did issue receipts in my name for all the monthly payments I made. 

","Okay, the receipts will help prove your case. For how long did you continue paying the monthly subscriptions? When did you stop?

"
242," I paid the Rs 20,000 every month diligently for the entire duration of 25 months till October 2017 when the chit fund cycle was supposed to end. I was the last member in this chit.

","What happened after you completed all the 25 month payments? Did you receive your chit amount from Mr. Govardhan Reddy? 

"
243," No, that is the issue. After I paid the entire amount, I approached him multiple times asking to pay me my chit amount of Rs 4,75,000 (after deducting his 5% commission). But he kept delaying and postponing on some pretext or the other.

","I understand. Can you please elaborate what excuses he gave for not paying your amount and how many months this went on?
"
244," He first said he has to manage finances for his daughter's wedding. Then over the next 2 years, he gave some reason or the other - financial constraints, bank delays, etc. In total, he did not pay me for almost 3 years after the chit fund ended. I approached him many times from November 2017 to August 2020 for my chit amount.

","That is a very long delay. What finally transpired in August 2020 after 3 years of chasing him? Were you able to recover your hard earned money?

"
245," In August 2020, I pressured him a lot and he finally agreed to execute a promissory note. He gave this written promise that he will pay the chit amount of Rs 4,75,000 along with interest at 24% per annum from November 2017 till August 2020. The total amount he promised in the promissory note was Rs 7,50,000.

","Okay, so you have this promissory note from August 2020. Further what happened.

"
246," As per the note, he said he will pay me in 3 months, but 3 months passed and he kept dodging. This continued for another few months despite my regular follow-ups. Finally in December 2020 he stopped responding to me. I lost hope of recovering my money. I have now decided to take legal recourse by filing a formal complaint against him with your assistance.

","I will certainly help you file an effective consumer complaint. Before that, do you have the promissory note given by Mr. Govardhan Reddy in August 2020? And the receipts of your 25 monthly payments? This will be important evidence.

"
247," Yes I have both. I have kept them safely ready. 

","Wonderful, that documentation will make your case very strong. Can you confirm that this entire chit fund business of Mr. Govardhan Reddy is unregistered and informal? There are no company documents?

"
248," Yes, absolutely. It is an unregistered, informal business. There are no company registration papers or anything like that. Just my receipts and his note. 

","Have you sent any legal notice to the opposite party? If not, I would  recommend you send one legal notice to the opposite party. 

"
249," I have not sent any legal notice to the opposite party. Kindly, draft a legal notice and the consumer complaint. 

","Here is the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints.

259," Hi, I'm Mohammed Jahangir. I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding an issue I'm facing related to a property.

","I'll be happy to assist you with the consumer complaint. Can you explain the issue in detail? 

"
260," Sure. Here's the background - I had purchased a residential plot in Mahabubnagar back in 2009. It was Plot No. 73, total area 150 square yards, located at Sy Nos. 260, 263 and 264 at Christianpally Sivar. This plot was registered in my wife's name, Shaheda Begum. After purchasing the plot, I constructed a house on it using my retirement benefits. Since the plot was in my wife's name, I got the house constructed in her name too.

","What problem did you face ?

"
261," The house that I constructed on the plot was allotted a municipal door number - 14-4-154/3 by the local authorities. My wife Shaheda Begum unfortunately passed away in 2015. After her death, I was left as the legal heir of the house along with our son and 6 daughters. But when I approached the municipal authorities to get the house mutated to my name as legal heir, I found that the house was already mutated to my son's name without my knowledge and consent. 

","How did this mutation happen without your consent? Can you elaborate.

"
262," It turned out my son had submitted a fabricated gift deed to the municipal authorities, falsely stating that my wife had gifted the house to him before her death. This was completely false - my wife never made any such gift deed. It was forged by my son to illegally transfer the property.

","Right, that clarifies the key issue. Your son used fraudulent means to get the property mutated in his name. What steps did you take after you uncovered this?

"
263," I immediately approached the municipal authorities and pointed out the fabrication. I gave them my wife's death certificate and my legal heir certificate proving the mutation was done illegally. I followed up with them multiple times through written and oral complaints.But they didn't take  any action.

","I can assist you with drafting the consumer complaint highlighting your main grievance against the municipal authorities. But you also have the option to send  the legal notice to the opposite party. 

"
264," Please go ahead and draft the notice. I'll be able to review it and provide any additional inputs needed.

","Could you please send your address and the address of the opposite parties. 

"
265," My address is the same as already stated, S/o Mohammad Abdul Aziz, aged 69 years, H.No.14-4-154/3, Shivashakthinagar,  Mahabubnagar town and district and the opposite parties address is 1. The Commissioner, Town Municipality, Mahabubnagar and 2.  Mohammad Mathin, 
S/o Mohammad Jahangir, aged 38 years, Occupation: Business, H.No.4-1-154/3, Shiva Shakthi Nagar, Mahabubnagar town and district.

","Here is the draft notice. Do you also want me to draft the complaint?

"
266," Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy. 

","Then you may file a consumer complaint. What remedy would you like to have from the consumer court. 

"
267," I would like to ask for cancellation of the transfer of property and recognise the complainant as a legal heir of Smt. Shaheda Begum and ask for appropriate compensationfor mental agony and hardship suffered by the Complainant.


","With respect to the jurisdiction, as you the complainant is a retired employee and is resident of Mahabubnagar town it is well within the jurisdiction of District consumer forum Mahabubnagar. Commission. So the complaint will  be filed in Mahabubnagar.

The company kept delaying and did not settle the claim. Initially on 15th June 2022 they replied that the claim will be processed but after that no response even after multiple follow-ups. It has been over a year now but I'm yet to receive any claim settlement.

","Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
"
354," I placed an order on XYZ e-commerce portal for a 55’ smart TV on 12/02/2022. I paid the cost price of Rs 60,000/- by way of NEFT (Transaction ID 67346281) and the scheduled delivery date was 14/02/2022 with a 10-day return policy. The TV was delivered on 16/02/2022 and installed on 18/02/2022. However, on 20/02/2022, the TV got switched off automatically while in use, and after that I could not boot up the device at all. 
","Okay. Could you please provide me with details regarding the name and registered office address of the manufacturer and the seller of the product? 
"
355," Manufacturer: Comet Manufacturers, 14/305, 8th street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos-60

","Thanks for the question. All three might be jointly and severally liable 
</INST> Also, did you raise the issue with the e-commerce platform? 
"
357," Yes, I did. On 21/02/2022 I contacted the customer support team, and when they asked me as to whether I wanted a replacement, or wanted the defect to be rectified, I said I was okay with anything. In turn, they told me that they would get in touch with the product seller, and that a technician would be sent in a few days’ time. 
</s> <s><INST> But, no one turned up. On 25/02/2022, I sent them an email requesting the platform to replace the defective TV, to which I received a reply stating that a technician would be sent in a few days’ time to look into the issue.

"
358," On 27/02/2022, a technician from the product seller’s company arrived. He checked the product and stated that the product would have to be replaced due to inherent manufacturing defects. Further, he told me to contact the product seller directly for a replacement. 
</s> <s><INST> On 27/02/2022, I got in touch with the product seller who assured me that a new TV would be installed in place of the defective one as soon as possible, but the TV has still not been replaced.
","Is there anything else that you would like to add?
"
359," In fact, I contacted the seller on 03/03/2022 to check if they had any plans of replacing the defective product, but did not receive a favorable response. I also emphasized the dual use of TV for me (source of news and entertainment), but all efforts went in vain. 
","I understand. Did you consider sending a legal notice to the product seller? 
"
360," Yes, I sent a notice dated 10/03/2022, but I haven’t yet received a reply from the seller. 
","Okay. 
</INST> Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum?

367," Hi Chatbot, I purchased a water purifier online last year which has been giving me trouble since day 1. 

","I understand, let's take this step-by-step so I can gather all the details. Could you start by providing your name, age, occupation and location details?

"
368," Sure, my name is Gouni Consumer Reddy, I'm 20 years old and currently a student. I reside at House no. 16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur Mandal in Wanaparthy District.

","Thank you for the introduction Mr. Gouni Consumer Reddy. Can you now explain the purchasing details as to the water purifier you had purchased?
"
369," I purchased an Aquasure Delight RO+UV+MTDS water purifier made by Eureka Forbes Limited. I bought it online through Amazon India on 6th August 2020 for the amount of Rs. 8,990/-. There was a delay in installation due to Covid restrictions at that time. The installation happened only on 25th August 2020, almost 20 days after delivery. But as soon as it was installed I noticed there was some leakage happening from the purifier. I complained about this defect on the same day, 25th August 2020.

","What response did you get from the company when you first complained about this leakage?

"
370," I called their customer care multiple times but there was no proper response. After continuously following up for 10 days, a service technician finally came after a month and was able to fix the leakage temporarily. The issues continued. While the leakage was fixed, now the purifier started taking too much time to purify water and also started wasting a lot of water during the process. I again started calling the Eureka Forbes customer care regularly to complain. They would assure me everytime that they were sending a technician within 24 hours, but no one would turn up for weeks.After waiting for a month, the technician came and said I need to install an additional filter in the purifier, which would cost me Rs. 380 extra. I had no choice but to agree and get it installed.

</INST>. Did installing this extra filter solve all the water purifier problems?

</s> <s><INST> No, even after installing the additional filter, I continued to face problems frequently. I had to call them multiple times again for the same issues. Then another technician came after a month and said the RO membrane had to be replaced. There was some improvement after the membrane was changed. But after about 1 week, the purifier stopped working again. Each time it would work only for a few days and then break down again.

","Very frustrating experience you have had. After all these issues, what did the company technicians finally say? 

"
371," Technician was of the opinion that it is better to go for replacement of the product. Based on this the complainant asked for the refund or replacement but the company said that the water purifier can not be replaced or returned only within 30 days of purchase as per the company’s terms and conditions. After this I registered a grievance on the consumer helpline website on 15-04-2021, vide No.2679203, after 3 months, I got a mail stating that “intimated customer as per policy can not refund or replace the unit after purchase of 10 months”.

","See the machine was not working since day one and there have been multiple attempts to approach the opposite party. I would also recommend you send the legal notice to the opposite party.

"
372," Yes, please draft the notice and ask for the replacement of the water purifier. 

","I would draft the complaint and the notice. But for this I need some additional information, like the name of the parties, your name and the name and address of the opposite party. Kindly noted that we will have 2 opposite parties, Eureka Forbes Ltd and Amazon India.

384,"  Certainly. My husband was approached by an agent from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd. on 20th February 2020, who convinced him to buy a health insurance policy. After some discussions, my husband agreed, and on 2nd March 2020, the agent collected Rs. 2,00,000 from us and issued the policy.
","Do you have any documentation regarding the policy?
"
385," : Yes, we have the policy document. 
","Thank you. Now, could you tell me what happened later.
"
386," My husband fell ill and was admitted to Apollo Hospital with Covid-19 pneumonia on 13th September 2020, we informed the insurance company about the situation and requested a claim form.
","And did they provide you with the necessary information and forms?
"
387,"  No, unfortunately, they didn't respond to our request.
","I see. What steps did you take after that?
"
388," : We wrote a letter to the insurance company on 15th March 2021, asking them to settle the claim, but still received no response.
","And did you take any further action?
"
389,"  Yes, we sent a registered legal notice to the company on 14th December 2021, but once again, they did not reply.
","I understand. Did you receive any communication from the insurance company during this time?
"
390," We didn't receive any response to our letters or legal notice. However, upon checking my father's bank statement, we noticed that the insurance company had transferred only Rs. 2,00,000 to his account on 29th December 2020, which is far less than the insured amount of Rs. 20,00,000.
","Thank you for providing me with all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.
"
391," I would like to seek the full claim of insurance, Rs.18,00,000 along with interest @ 12% p.a., after deduction of the Rs.2,00,000 deposited in the account. I would like to seek an additional compensation of Rs. 3,00,000.

429," Hello. I'm Mr. P.V. Dhananjayudu, an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army. I need help regarding an issue I'm facing with the Municipal Corporation of Mahabubnagar. They are not providing me the tax exemption on my house that I'm eligible for as an ex-serviceman.

","I understand. Let's discuss this in detail so I can understand the full context and provide the best assistance. Could you please confirm your name, age, address and occupation for my records?

"
430," Sure,I'm 71 years old and reside at Plot No.3, H.No.8-6-8/A/20, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar town and district. I'm an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army.

</INST>. Could you please explain from the beginning how you became eligible for this tax exemption?

</s> <s><INST> Yes, of course. So as part of the rehabilitation program for ex-servicemen, the State Government had allotted me 200 sq yards of land in Survey No. 211/2 at Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar under the ex-servicemen quota. After the land allotment, I constructed a house after taking the required permission from the Mahabubnagar Municipal Corporation, who are the Opposite Party in my complaint. They had provided the construction permission vide letter no. L.R.No.61/BA/298/1046/99 dated 04.02.2000.The Municipal Corporation allotted house number 8-6-8/A/20 for the property after it was constructed. As per government order G.O.Ms.No.83 issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department, dated 15.03.1997, ex-servicemen of the armed forces are eligible for exemption from payment of house tax for one residential property. So based on this government, I am eligible for exemption as an ex-serviceman.

","What steps did you take to apply for this tax exemption from the Municipal Corporation?

"
431," I had submitted all the required documents to the Municipal Corporation requesting them to provide me the tax exemption. This includes my ex-serviceman ID proofs, property documents and the Government Order document itself. I submitted this request first on 26.09.2020. Unfortunately, the Municipal Corporation did not accept my application. In fact, on 18.09.2022, before I applied, they had sent me a tax demand notice asking me to pay Rs. 2637 as the annual house tax.. After they sent that demand notice, I submitted another request on 27.09.2022 explaining my eligibility criteria again and asking them to reconsider.

","You have the option to send a legal notice or file a complaint. 

"
432," Kindly draft me a legal notice. 

","For this I will  need the address of the Municipal corporation, kindly provide its address. 

"
433,"The Municipal Commissioner, Mahabubnagar Municipality, Mahabubnagar, Telangana.

","Here is the draft notice that you can send to the Municipality in order to get the tax exemption. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

"
434," Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy. 

","Then you may file a consumer complaint. What remedy would you like to have from the consumer court. 

"
435," As a relief I want the opposite party to cancel the house tax demand and issue house tax exemption certificate to the complainant also  ask for Rs. 10000/- Rs as compensation for mental agony and inconvenience caused;

","I will draft the complaint.. The jurisdiction for the complaint will be Mahabubnagar as the complainant resides there and the opposite party has office at Mahabubnagar . Kindly, upload the relevant documents. The complaint will be filed in District Consumer Disputes Redressal Mahabubnagar as it has the jurisdiction in the present matter. 

"
436," Yes, please do assist me in lodging a proper complaint against them. I am uploading all the necessary documents.

In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?

"
441," Hi, I need help filing a complaint against an insurance company that has rejected my husband's accident insurance claim. 

","Could you please explain the complete details about the problem you faced?

"
442," Sure. My name is Katta Amrutha. My late husband Katta Shekhar Reddy had taken an insurance policy for his two-wheeler from Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company. It was policy number 3397/00127036/000/00 which he had taken in June 2019. The policy provided accident cover of Rs 15 lakhs in case of death of the insured. It was for the time period from 06/06/2019 to 05/06/2024.

","Could you now please walk me through what happened after he took this policy? 

"
443," My husband met with a motorcycle accident on 10th May 2020. He suffered serious injuries in the accident and passed away the same day. As his wife and nominee, I submitted the accident insurance claim to Cholamandalam MS Insurance on 5th June 2020, providing all documents. But they have illegally rejected my claim.

","Okay. Did they give any reasons for claim rejection? 

"
444," They arbitrarily said that it was not an accidental death but due to heart attack, which is completely false. The police report and the inquest report clearly shows he died due to accident injuries.

","could you please share what steps you have taken after they rejected your claim? Have you approached them again?

"
445," Yes, after their initial rejection I have written many emails and made countless calls to their customer care requesting them to review and settle my claim. But they are just giving me pointless excuses. No one is addressing my grievance.

","I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Could you please confirm if you have filed a formal complaint with the insurance company's grievance redressal department along with supporting documents? 

"
446," Yes I filed the formal complaint with their grievance department on 05/06/2020, attaching all documents. But they simply sent a meaningless reply rejecting it again without any reason.I have no other option now but to seek external help. 

","Have you sent any legal notice after rejection of the complaint  from the company's grievance redressal department. 

"
447," Yes. I have sent a legal notice on 12-10-2020. I would like to file a complaint now.

","Thank you for giving me the full sequence of events. I could assist you in drafting a complaint. Would you like me to generate one for you?

"
448," Yes. It would be really helpful.

","In order to draft a complaint I need some other details like the address of the parties based on that I would also recommend a jurisdiction in which the complaint can be filed.
"
449,"With respect to the address, specify my address as Smt. Katta Amrutha W/o Late Shekhar Reddy, Aged 40 years, Occupation: Housewife, Resident of MIG-21, Housing Board Colony,  Mahabubnagar, Mahabubnagar District - 509001 and the opposite party address as The Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited, Represented by its Branch Manager, #1-2-73/2 & 1-2-63 to 64, No.302, 3rd Floor, SR Arcade, Parklane, Above Bank of Baroda, Secunderabad, Hyderabad - 500 001.

","Thanks for sharing the address. In the present case for the issue of jurisdiction, the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar and Hyderabad will have jurisdiction as the complainant has residence at Mahabubnagar and the opposite party has registered office in Hyderabad. Which jurisdiction would you prefer? I think you should go for the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar as it is your place of residence and therefore  would be convenient for you. 

"
450," Yes, the jurisdiction of District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar would work fine for me. 
","Could you please tell what relief you expect from the court, do you want your vehicle back or do you need your money as compensation for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party. 
"
451," In terms of remedy I would like to have a compensation amount of Rs.15,00,000/- covered under the Policy and Rs.15,000/- towards compensation for mental agony and Rs. 10,000 as cost of the complaint. 

","Thank you for the confirmation, I will draft the initial consumer complaint and share it with you soon for your review. Please feel free to suggest any changes or additions as required. But before  that could you please specify what proof you have with regards to the claims that you have made. 

"
452," Yes I have relevant policy documents, claim rejection letter, police report, inquest  report  and other relevant documents which will help me to establish my case.

472," Hello. I'm Mr. P.V. Dhananjayudu, an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army. I need help regarding an issue I'm facing with the Municipal Corporation of Mahabubnagar. They are not providing me the tax exemption on my house that I'm eligible for as an ex-serviceman.

","I understand. Let's discuss this in detail so I can understand the full context and provide the best assistance. Could you please confirm your name, age, address and occupation for my records?

"
473," Sure,I'm 71 years old and reside at Plot No.3, H.No.8-6-8/A/20, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar town and district. I'm an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army.

</INST>. Could you please explain from the beginning how you became eligible for this tax exemption?

</s> <s><INST> Yes, of course. So as part of the rehabilitation program for ex-servicemen, the State Government had allotted me 200 sq yards of land in Survey No. 211/2 at Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar under the ex-servicemen quota. After the land allotment, I constructed a house after taking the required permission from the Mahabubnagar Municipal Corporation, who are the Opposite Party in my complaint. They had provided the construction permission vide letter no. L.R.No.61/BA/298/1046/99 dated 04.02.2000.The Municipal Corporation allotted house number 8-6-8/A/20 for the property after it was constructed. As per government order G.O.Ms.No.83 issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department, dated 15.03.1997, ex-servicemen of the armed forces are eligible for exemption from payment of house tax for one residential property. So based on this government, I am eligible for exemption as an ex-serviceman.

","What steps did you take to apply for this tax exemption from the Municipal Corporation?

"
474," I had submitted all the required documents to the Municipal Corporation requesting them to provide me the tax exemption. This includes my ex-serviceman ID proofs, property documents and the Government Order document itself. I submitted this request first on 26.09.2020. Unfortunately, the Municipal Corporation did not accept my application. In fact, on 18.09.2022, before I applied, they had sent me a tax demand notice asking me to pay Rs. 2637 as the annual house tax.. After they sent that demand notice, I submitted another request on 27.09.2022 explaining my eligibility criteria again and asking them to reconsider.

","You have the option to send a legal notice or file a complaint. 

"
475," Kindly draft me a legal notice. 

","For this I will  need the address of the Municipal corporation, kindly provide its address. 

"
476,"The Municipal Commissioner, Mahabubnagar Municipality, Mahabubnagar, Telangana.

","Here is the draft notice that you can send to the Municipality in order to get the tax exemption. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

"
477," Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy. 

","Then you may file a consumer complaint. What remedy would you like to have from the consumer court. 

"
478," As a relief I want the opposite party to cancel the house tax demand and issue house tax exemption certificate to the complainant also  ask for Rs. 10000/- Rs as compensation for mental agony and inconvenience caused;

","I will draft the complaint.. The jurisdiction for the complaint will be Mahabubnagar as the complainant resides there and the opposite party has office at Mahabubnagar . Kindly, upload the relevant documents. The complaint will be filed in District Consumer Disputes Redressal Mahabubnagar as it has the jurisdiction in the present matter.

497," Hello, I am Shruti Goyal, and I am from Moga, Punjab. I have a consumer issue with a makeup artist named Arushi Oswal.
","I'm sorry to hear that. Can you provide more details about the issue you faced with Arushi Oswal's makeup services?
"
498," Certainly. I paid Arushi Rs. 5000 in cash and Rs. 5000 by bank transfer for makeup services. However, she hasn't provided me with a receipt for the cash payment.
","I understand your concern. To assist you better, can you please elaborate on the issue? 
"
499," I don’t remember the date I availed of the makeup services. I went to her salon, which is named the Arushi Oswal Make-up Academy. She told me that since several other customers were waiting, she would send the receipt to me via WhatsApp later.  I have raised multiple requests for the receipt but I have not received a response. 
","Thank you for providing those details. Is it possible for you to recollect the month when you availed services from here?
"
500," The month is August 2022. That much I remember.
","Got it. Since you availed the services of the academy, it will be the opposite party and not Arushi Oswal in her capacity. Do you have any messages or emails exchanged between you and Arushi Oswal regarding the makeup services and the payment? 
"
501," Yes, I do. I sent her several WhatsApp messages for the receipt but she has not replied.
","Based on what you've told me, it appears there's a lack of documentation for the cash payment, causing you mental agony. You have a valid grievance for which you can seek redressal, i.e., get relief. Let me know what kind of remedy you are seeking and how much you want for the same.
"
502," I want compensation for mental agony and a refund of 10,000 Rs.. Compensation for mental agony can be 20,000 Rs. 
","In order to get the relief that you are seeking, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Forum that has jurisdiction to hear your case. You can also go for mediation or contact the Punjab State Consumer Helpline to assist you in this regard. You can find the helpline number here. Please feel free to ask me any clarifications regarding each of the options I have presented to you. 
"
503," What will happen if I call the state consumer helpline?
","The Punjab State Consumer Helpline will hear your grievance and will guide you by providing the steps involved in filing a case. They will also render advice regarding the strength of your case. 
"
504," What about mediation?
","mediation is a form of settling disputes outside courts. In mediation, neutral third persons called mediators assist the parties in arriving at an amicable settlement. The mediators cannot decide the case but can only aim for an amicable settlement between the parties. If the parties do not agree for a settlement, then the mediation process comes to an end, resulting in the parties having to seek other methods of settling their dispute, including going to court.
"
505," Let me directly go to court.
","Got it. Before you file a complaint before the forum, you would have to send a fifteen-day notice to Arushi Oswal. If you don't receive a satisfactory response or if you don't receive a response from her after a period of fifteen days, you can initiate legal action by approaching the consumer court. Do you want me to draft a notice for you?
"
506," Yes, it would be helpful if you could draft a notice.
","In order to draft a notice, I would require you to send me your full name and address and the opposite party’s, i.e.; the  make-up academy’s full name and address. 
"
507," My full name is Shruti Goyal and I live in House No. 689, Street No. 6 of Vedant Nagar, Moga, Punjab. I only have Aarushi Oswal’s Make-up Academy’s address, which is located at 148/1, Oswal Bhawan, Seth Sohan Lal Ln, MJR, Civil Lines, Ludhiana, Punjab-141001. Is this enough?
","yes, it is not a problem that you have given Aarushi’s Academy’s address. In the notice, the relief that you are seeking must be mentioned. Here you are seeking a refund along with compensation for mental agony. Is it okay if the notice directs the initiation of a refund of 10,000 Rs. and payment of compensation for mental agony within fifteen days?
"
508," Yes, that is what I want. I can wait for fifteen days.
","Got it. Now, do you want to send the notice by post or by email? If you want it to be via email, please give me your email ID which can be used by Arushi Oswal if she wants to send a reply. What would you prefer?
"
509," I prefer email. You can use my email address: shruti@gmail.com.
","Thank you. You can access the notice here. Please keep in mind that your signature is required in the notice. You can either take a printout of the notice and sign it, or else you can e-sign it. Also mention the date in the notice before you send it. If you don't receive a satisfactory response or if you don't receive a response within fifteen days, you can initiate legal action by filing a complaint before the consumer forum. Do you want me to guide you on how you can file a complaint?
"
510," Yes, please provide me with the steps on how I can file a complaint before the consumer forum.
","First, I would have to determine which consumer forum has the jurisdiction, i.e., the authority to hear your case. In your case, you reside in Moga while the Opposite Party carries on business in Ludhiana. Due to this, you can file a complaint in the consumer forum that is in Moga or in Ludhiana. Which option do you prefer?
"
511," I prefer filing in Moga.
","Great. In that case, do you want me to draft a pre-filled complaint that you can use?
"
512," Yes, it will be great if you can draft a complaint which I can use.
","For that, I'll need some documents, including any messages or emails exchanged between you and Arushi Oswal regarding the makeup services and payment and the receipt of the bank transfer that you made. I would also require your father or husband’s name, your age and your occupation. You can upload the documents here.
(Upon uploading documents)
"
513," My husband’s name is Radhe Mohan Garg. I am 29 years old and I work as an architect. 
","Thank you. You can access the pre-filled complaint here. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the ""Memorandum of Parties."" Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?
"
514," Yes, it will be great if you can do that as well.
","You can access the Affidavit here and the Memorandum of Parties here. You are required to fill in the details that have been left empty in both documents.

"
533," Hi Chatbot. I need help with filing a consumer complaint. I purchased a motor pump set for agricultural use which has now been damaged.

","Can you tell me about the item you purchased and the issue you are facing?

"
534," I purchased a MARATHIN MAK 10 HP 1440 RPMTEF motor pump set for Rs. 20,750 from a dealer named Balaji Agricultural Agencies located at Secunderabad. I bought this on 23rd September 2020 for agricultural use in my fields and was under the warranty. 

","Could you please share more details like the warranty period and invoice number if available?

"
535," Yes, the motor pump set was under a warranty period of 1 year from the date of purchase. I have the original purchase invoice, - the invoice is numbered 45621 dated 23/09/2020.

","Thank you for providing the warranty and invoice details. Now, can you explain what exactly is the issue you are facing with this motor pump set?

"
536," The motor pump set worked fine initially. But within a few months of purchase, it started giving some problems. It would make loud noises and eventually stopped working completely after some time. Since it was within the 1 year warranty period, I wanted to get it repaired by the dealer under warranty.

","Okay. Did you contact the dealer regarding this?

"
537," Yes, I approached the dealer and requested them to repair it under warranty. They asked me to send the motor to them and they would repair and return it. But  the motor got  damaged in transit. 

","Alright. Can you please explain how you sent the defective motor pump set to the dealer? 

"
538," For transporting the motor pump set, I used a transportation company named Navata Road Transport. On 22nd January 2021, I booked the item through them and sent it to the dealer for repairs.

","I see. Please provide more details about Navata Road Transport - their address, waybill number etc. Also, how much value did you declare for the motor pump set while booking the transportation?

"
539," Navata Road Transport is located in Nagarkurnool, their main office address is Door No. 18-667, Bose Buildings, Kanuru, Vijayawada. I booked the item via their Nagarkurnool branch. The waybill number is SO94101-1 dated 22/01/2021. As for declared value, I specified Rs. 5,000 while booking the transportation through them.

","Thank you for the transportation details. You mentioned the motor pump set reached the dealer in a damaged condition. Can you please elaborate what kind of damage had occurred?

"
540," Yes, when the motor pump reached the dealer, it was completely damaged. The base and body were bent and crushed, the terminal plate was broken, and the motor was in completely unrepairable condition. The dealer informed me that due to the extensive transit damage, they cannot accept or repair it under warranty.

","Did you follow up with Navata Road Transport regarding this damage? 

"
541," I immediately contacted Navata Road Transport and questioned them about how the motor was damaged so badly during transit. But they did not give any satisfactory response regarding this. They also refused to take any responsibility for the damage.

","What did Navata Road Transport convey when you contacted them? Did they inspect the damaged motor pump set?

"
542," When I called them and complained, they simply denied any liability. They insisted the motor pump was in fine condition when transported and refused to even inspect the damaged item. I got no proper response despite multiple complaints to Navata Road Transport.

","In this scenario, did you take up this issue with the dealer as well?

"
543," Yes, I informed the dealer Balaji Agricultural Agencies about how the motor was damaged during transit by Navata Road Transport. I requested them to address this issue and arrange for repairs under warranty as promised. However, they also refused to take any responsibility in the matter.

","Alright, so neither the transportation company nor the dealer were helpful in getting this resolved. Can you summarise the loss you have incurred due to this damaged motor pump set?

"
544," Due to the motor being damaged, I have suffered a huge loss. Firstly, I have lost the cost of the motor pump set itself, which is Rs. 20,750 that I spent to purchase it. Secondly, I have not been able to carry out agricultural activities properly without the motor pump set, leading to production losses. I estimate the production losses to be around Rs. 1 lakh.

","Thank you for patiently providing the full details. Given the facts of the case, I would recommend sending a legal notice to both the transport company Navata Road Transport and the dealer Balaji Agricultural Agencies under the Consumer Protection Act 2019. I can assist you in drafting the complaint. Would you like me to proceed with preparing a draft consumer complaint?

"
545," Yes please, I would like you to draft the consumer complaint on my behalf against both the transporter and dealer to seek compensation for my losses. Please include all the relevant details we discussed.
","Kindly share your address.

"
572," Yes, I approached M/s I Pacific multiple times since December 2022 for inspection and servicing but found their establishment closed down. There was no response on calling them either.
","Okay, so they essentially shut down operations without any notice or intimation to customers?
"
573," Yes, that's right. It seems like the company has shut down but I was not informed at all as a customer. The bike is still under warranty period but I have no one to reach out to for servicing now.

582,"  I have been facing some issues with VLCC Health Care Limited regarding a cosmetic treatment that I have received. 
","Could you please provide me with more details about what happened?
"
583,"  Yes, I'm very unhappy with the treatment I received from VLCC Health Care Limited. I went there for a cosmetic procedure, but they didn't provide me with the treatment that was promised.
","I see. Could you walk me through what happened, starting from when you first consulted them?
"
584,"  I visited VLCC Health Care Limited on 11th December 2020 to inquire about a cosmetic treatment. Dr. Rinku Aher examined me and recommended a specific treatment involving Voluma and stem cell therapy. I agreed to proceed with the treatment, and they quoted me a price of Rs. 36,398 for it.
","And did you go ahead with the treatment as recommended?
"
585,"  Yes, I did. I deposited an amount of Rs. 9,558 in advance on 12th January 2021, and the treatment was done on 13th January 2021. However, after the treatment, I experienced discomfort, and when I received the bill on 15th January 2021, I noticed that they had used Botox instead of stem cell therapy, which was not what Dr. Aher had recommended.
","That sounds concerning. Did you confront them about this discrepancy?
"
586,"  Yes, I spoke to the manager, Dr. Neelima Balla, on 17th January 2021, but she didn't provide any satisfactory explanation. So, I followed up with her via email on 20th January 2021, asking for details about the treatment process and the brand of products they used. Dr. Balla replied on 30th January 2021, claiming that they had used a product called ""Micro Gold Botox,"" which supposedly contained stem cells.
","And how did you react to this response?
"
587,"  I was not convinced because I specifically opted for stem cell therapy, not Botox. Feeling deceived, I issued a legal notice to VLCC Health Care Limited on 9th April 2021, demanding compensation for their actions. However, instead of addressing my concerns, they replied with baseless allegations.
","Thank you for sharing all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.

For the affidavit, please sign it before a notary public and have the affidavit notarized. Both documents should be scanned and uploaded to the e-daakhil portal. Do you have any other questions or is there more information you'd like?

"
627," No, that's all for now. Thanks.

","You're welcome. If you have further questions or need more guidance later, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your complaint.
"
628," Hello, I  faced a problem with my train ticket booking. 

","Could you please provide me some basic details about your grievance so that I have the full context?

"
629," Sure. I had booked two train tickets from Madurai to Chennai for a journey on 20.08.2019. The tickets were booked on 12.08.2019 for me and another elderly, disabled person who was to travel with me. However, when we went to board the train on the day of the journey, we were denied boarding by
 the ticket inspector saying my name was wrongly printed on the ticket.

","I understand. Could you please provide me your full name, age, address and contact details for the records? This would be required when filing the consumer complaint.

"
630," My name is R. Jawahar, I am 70 years old and work at my shop for a living.  My address is - Mela Chinnampatti, Kalvelippatti Post, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District, PIN 625514. My mobile number is 9999xxxxxx.

","Thank you for providing your details, Mr Jawahar. Could you also please confirm the complete details of your co-passenger - his name, age, disability details, address and contact number?

"
631," Sure. His name is G. Kannan, age 61 years, Occupation: Retired Employee(Revenue Department). He is physically handicapped and needs my support to travel. His address is - D.No. 2/691, Bharathi Nagar, Kannanendal, Madurai - 625014. His mobile number is 8888yyyyyy. 

","Noted. So if I understand correctly, you and Mr Kannan had booked confirmed train tickets from Madurai to Chennai for the 20.08.2019 journey. But you both were denied boarding due to incorrect names printed for you on the tickets. Right?

"
632," Yes, that is right. When we reached the station and tried to board, the ticket inspector informed me that my name was printed incorrectly as 'Sri Murugan' instead of 'R. Jawahar' on the reservation chart. My age was also wrongly mentioned as 45 years instead of 70 years. Due to this mistake in the chart, we were denied boarding on the train.

","Okay. Could you please confirm:

1. Date when you had booked the tickets: 
2. How did you book the tickets - online or at the station counter?
3. The train PNR number:
4. Exact mistake in the name/age printed on reservation chart:

This will help me capture the full details.

"
633," Sure, here are the details:

1. We booked the tickets on 12.08.2019
2. The booking was done at Madurai Railway station reservation counter by submitting manual requisition form
3. The PNR number was 8765091230 
4. My name was printed as 'Sri Murugan' instead of 'R. Jawahar' and age was shown as 45 years instead of 70 years

I have the ticket copies and reservation form copy for proof.

","Thank you Mr Jawahar. This provides me with the complete context of what transpired. Just a few more questions, what did you do after being denied boarding - did you still travel or cancel your journey? 

"
634," We were forced to cancel our train journey and had to urgently book bus tickets to travel on that day to Chennai. This caused grave inconvenience as the bus journey was much more uncomfortable for us.

","Did you face any financial losses or other difficulties due to this issue?

"
635," We suffered financial loss as we had to purchase costlier bus tickets on urgent booking. We also had to cancel our confirmed return train bookings from Chennai to Madurai scheduled for 21.08.2019, as we did not travel by train on the onward journey.

","As you have used an alternate mode to transport can you please tell the approximate financial loss suffered by you and Mr Kannan due to - 
   a) Purchasing alternative bus tickets
   b) Cancellation of return train tickets

"
636," Financial loss details:
   a) We spent approx Rs 3000 per person on urgent booking of bus tickets
   b) The cancelled return train tickets were of approx Rs 400 per person
","Did you submit any written complaint to Railway authorities and receive any response?

"
637," Yes I submitted a written complaint to railway authorities (on 03.12.2019) regarding deficiency in service and mental agony caused to us. But I did not receive any response or resolution to the complaint.


","So this is a clear case of deficiency of service. You can send a legal notice and also file a complaint against the other party. What do you want me to draft for you?

"
638," Kindly draft the legal notice and the complaint for me. 

","For the purpose of drafting notice and complaint, could you please confirm your residential address again so I have it on record for jurisdiction purposes.

"
639," My residential address is  Mela Chinnampatti, Kalvelippatti Post, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District, PIN 625514. 

","Do you have any documents evidencing the train reservation, complaint to railway etc that can be enclosed with the consumer complaint?Please upload them.

"
640," Yes I have the following documents and uploaded them.
   - Original train reservation ticket 
   - Cancelled return reservation tickets
   - Copy of manual reservation form submitted to book tickets
   - Copy of written complaint dated 03.12.2019 submitted to Railways
   - Copy of reservation chart showing incorrect details

Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?

"
645," Hello. I purchased a new car recently but I'm facing some serious issues with it. I would like to file a complaint against the car manufacturer and dealer.

","I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss this in detail so I can understand the full context and help you draft a complaint. Could you please mention your name? 

"
646," My name is P. Shankar
 
","What is your age?
"
647,"40
 
","What is your Occupation?
"
648," I am employee at Raymond

","What is your Address?
 "
649," I reside at No.14, Valarmathi Compound, Indra Nagar, Vedasandur, Dindigul District. 

","Thank you for providing your details Mr. Shankar. Can you please explain what happened from the beginning so I have the complete timeline of events?

"
650," Sure. On 26th April 2017, I booked a new Ciaz Alpha Diesel car from the authorized Maruti Suzuki dealer - Asir Automobiles Pvt Ltd, located at Chellam Bappusamy Hall, 80 Feet Road, KK Nagar, Madurai. I paid 10 lakhs for this care and the same is reflected in the invoice no. 5624.

","Okay, let me note down the name and address of the authorized dealer - Asir Automobiles Pvt Ltd, Chellam Bappusamy Hall, 80 Feet Road, KK Nagar, Madurai. Please continue.

"
651," The dealer delivered the new car to me on 8th May 2017. I took the car from the showroom directly to a nearby temple. While returning home, within a few kilometers of driving, there was smoke and fire erupting from the front of the car and it came to an abrupt halt. Luckily my family and I could come out safely without any injuries. 

","That must have been a terrifying experience! I understand the car caught fire suddenly on 8th May 2017 while you were driving back from the temple. What did you do next after this incident?

"
652," I immediately called the dealer Asir Automobiles around 8:30 PM on the same day and informed them about this manufacturing defect. I requested them to take back this defective vehicle and provide a replacement. 

","Makes sense. So on 8th May 2017 itself you contacted the dealer and asked for a replacement due to a manufacturing defect. What was their response?

"
653," But the dealer did not agree to replace the car. They just sent their service technicians the next day to repair that specific defective vehicle. 

","Hmm...so the dealer refused to replace the car and tried to simply repair the same defective vehicle. What steps did you take then?

"
654," I submitted a written complaint to the Inspector of Police, Anna Nagar Police Station, Madurai on 9th May 2017 regarding this matter, requesting appropriate action.

","Okay, you submitted a police complaint on 9th May 2017 to highlight this issue. Did the dealer take any further steps after your police complaint?

"
655," Shockingly, the dealer submitted a false counter-complaint to the same Inspector on 11th May 2017. They claimed that only some minor repairs were done to the AC compressor and belt of my car, and that I was insisting on a replacement without reason.

","Right, so the dealer actually tried to cover this up by submitting a false counter-complaint. This is definitely unethical. What was the final resolution of this issue?  

"
656," Ultimately, I was forced to book another new Ciaz car of the same model on 15th May 2017. The dealer asked me to pay Rs 1 lakh to them first before they would give the replacement car. Only after I paid this amount, they provided the replacement car on 24th May 2017.

","I understand - you had to unwillingly pay Rs 1 lakh extra and book another new car to get your issue resolved. That is unfair treatment. Have you taken any action like sending legal notice? 

"
657," Yes, I had sent a legal notice to both the dealer Asir Automobiles and the car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki via registered post on 14th October 2017. But they failed to respond to my notice.

","Here is the notice if you wish to send it again. I think you should file a consumer complaint. Would you like me to draft a complaint for you?

"
658," Yes, kindly draft  a complaint for me. 

","For this I would like to have some additional information. Do you have documentation for all the evidence, like car invoice, dealer communication, police complaint copy etc?
"
659," I have maintained proper documentation of all evidence like the car invoice, dealer communications, police complaint copy, amount paid receipts etc. I can provide photocopies of these documents as annexures to the complaint.


","The jurisdiction for the complaint can be District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Madurai, New Delhi and Dindigul . Where would you like to file the complaint?

"
660," I  would like to file a complaint at Madurai. 

","What compensation amount are you seeking from the dealer and manufacturer?

"
661," I am seeking a compensation amount of Rs 2 lakhs from the dealer and manufacturer for their negligent service and unfair trade practice. 


","Thank you. On the basis of the documents that you have given me, I have drafted a pre-filled complaint that you can access here. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?

"
662," Yes, it will be great if you can do that as well.

Further, you must get the affidavit notarised. In case of any queries regarding how you can get the Affidavit notarised, feel free to approach me anytime.

"
666," Hi, I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding an issue I'm facing with a finance company.
","Could you please explain the complete details about your issue?

"
667," Okay, here is the background - My name is Syed Sidiq Pasha and I am an auto driver residing in Mahabubnagar. In November 2016, I purchased an auto rickshaw bearing registration number TS 06 UB 3143 from a dealer named Samskruthi Automobiles.

","</INST> What problem did you face ?

"
668," This auto was originally purchased by another person named Varanasi Ashanna. He had obtained finance from a company called Fortune Integrated Assets Finance Ltd to buy the auto on loan. Ashanna could not pay the monthly installments for the loan regularly. So Fortune Integrated seized the auto from him. That's when Samskruthi Automobiles, who is an agent for Fortune Integrated, sold the seized auto to me in November 2016 and according to the terms of agreement I would pay the remaining loan installments to Fortune Integrated in monthly payments.

","Understood. Please provide more details about the terms of payment for purchasing this pre-used auto from Samskruthi Automobiles.

"
669," As per the agreement, I had to pay Fortune Integrated the balance loan amount in 30 monthly installments of Rs. 5,800 each. I paid 4 installments upfront at the time of purchase in November 2016.I paid them regularly the remaining installment for over 2 years.

","Great. Please confirm how many installments you paid in total before any issue arose?

"
670," I paid 27 installments promptly till March 2019, paying almost Rs. 1,56,600. Then I approached Samskruthi Automobiles requesting them to accept the remaining 3 installments in full so I could get the auto registration transferred to my name.But Samskruthi Automobiles started behaving strangely at that time. They said they had misplaced my agreement and kept delaying and postponing the matter whenever I approached them.

","Did you follow up with them again after this?

"
671," Yes, I followed up with them continuously after that for almost 1 year but they kept stalling. And then in February 2020, they seized my auto arbitrarily without any prior notice.Then they started demanding additional ₹78,874 for releasing my auto despite having already received ₹1,56,600 from me.

","Did they explain why they were demanding this additional amount?

"
672," They gave some vague reasons that I had pending installments and interest due. But it was all lies to try and extract more money from me. I had already paid as per the original agreement terms.

","In that case we should send a legal notice to the opposite party. May I draft a legal notice for you.

"
673," Yes, Kindly draft the notice. 

","Kindly note, in order to draft the legal notice, I will need your proper address and the address of the opposite party.

"
674," My address is Syed Sidiq Pasha, S/o Syed Yousuf, Aged 52 years, Occ: Auto Driver, R/o H.No.4-2-16/6, Ramaiah Bowli, Mahabubnagar town & district and the opposite party address is The Authorized Signatory, Samskruthi Automobiles, RSP with: Fortune Integrated Assets Finance Ltd., #5-85/20A, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar town. 


","Here is the draft notice. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. .In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you to call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?
 Do you also need me to draft the complaint? 

"
675," I have already approached them so many times I do not think notice will have any impact on the conduct of the opposite party. Please go ahead and draft the initial complaint. I'll review it and provide my inputs.

","Could you please tell what relief you expect from the court, do you want your vehicle back or do you need your money as compensation for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party. This will help me to specify the remedy in the complaint.

"
676," I want my vehicle back and some compensation for the loss I have suffered due to arbitrary seized possession of my vehicle.

","Thanks for sharing the address. With respect to the jurisdiction, the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar will have jurisdiction as both the parties have residence and office at Mahabubnagar. I hope this works for you. 

"
677," Yes, the jurisdiction of District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar would work fine for me.  

","Sure, I'll draft the initial version of the consumer complaint for your review covering all the details we discussed today.

","Certainly. Could you please provide me with further details 
"
684," I've had an SB Account with the State Bank of India, Dondaparthi Branch for many years. Recently, Mr. Sharma, a Senior Associate of the bank,  advised me to open fixed deposits to receive better benefits. Trusting his advice and my faith in the bank, I handed over three cheques, each drawn for Rs. 7,00,000, to Mr. Sharma to have deposits made in the names of my three children.
","And what happened after you handed over the cheques to Mr. Sharma?
"
685,"  Unfortunately, I did not receive any fixed deposit certificates as expected. Despite my repeated requests and visits to Mr. Sharma, he kept postponing the issuance of the certificates, stating that they were still under process. However, I later discovered that Rs. 3441 each was being credited to my account from 28/11/2017 onwards against an annuity pension scheme, which I never agreed to or signed up for.
","That sounds like a concerning situation. Did you raise your concerns with the Manager or anyone else at the bank?
"
686,"  Yes, I approached the Branch Manager in February 2018 and informed them that I never requested or agreed to any policies. I also mentioned that even if policies were issued, I never received any documents related to them. I explained that had I been served with the documents, I would have been able to cancel the policies within the free look period.
","Have you received any response from the opposite parties regarding your complaints?
"
687,"  Unfortunately, despite sending several reminders between 01/10/2019 and 24/07/2021, the opposite parties did not address my concerns or take any action. Finally, on 07/02/2020, they rejected my request to cancel the policies.
","I see. It seems like the opposite parties have not been responsive to your grievances. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are seeking for.
"
688," I would like to seek a refund of Rs.21,00,000/- for the three policies and credit the same into my SB account No. 32906316511, Rs. 3,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony and Rs.20,000/- for costs
","Based on the above information provided you could file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, or you could also contact the respective Consumer Helpline Number where you can talk to an agent and address your grievance.

The complainant, holding SB Account No. 32906316511 with the 1st opposite party for years, followed advice from Mr. Sharma, a Senior Associate, to deposit three cheques of Rs. 7,00,000 each for better benefits without specifying bearer's names. He expected fixed deposit certificates but didn't receive them. Instead, Rs. 3441 each started crediting to his account from 28/11/2017 for an annuity pension scheme, which he never opted for. Despite informing the 2nd Opposite Party in February 2018, and multiple reminders till 24/07/2021, they failed to cancel the policies, allegedly exploiting the complainant's old age for personal gain, prompting the complaint for deficient service.

732," Hello, I am Vasantha Ruban from Aruppukottai, Virudhunagar District. I purchased an auto rickshaw for my livelihood, but I am facing some issues with the loan I took from a finance company. I need help to file a consumer complaint against them.

","I understand sir/ma’am. Let's discuss this step-by-step so I can gather all the necessary details to assist you. Could you please confirm your full name?

"
733," Yes, my name is Vasantha Ruban. 

","What is your father’s name?
"
734," Alagukrishnan

","What is your occupation?
 "
735," Auto driver

","What is your address?
"
736," I am residing at No.4, 6th Street, Anbu Nagar, Aruppukottai, Virudhunagar District.

","Thank you for providing your details. Could you please tell me the name and addresses of the finance company against whom you want to file the complaint?

"
737," The loan was provided by Fortune Integrated Assets Limited. Their branch office address is:
The Branch Manager, Fortune Integrated Assets Limited, AR Plaza, 2nd Floor, No.16/17, North Veli Street, Madurai - 625001. 

","Noted. What was the purpose of taking this loan and when did you take it?

"
738," I took out a loan to purchase an auto rickshaw to earn my livelihood. I purchased the vehicle on 20.08.2018 after taking a loan of Rs. 2,35,000 from Fortune Integrated Assets Limited.

","Could you please provide the loan account number and the vehicle registration details?

"
739," The loan account number is XXXXXXX. The auto rickshaw registration number is TN 67 BW 0603. 

","Thank you for the details. What were the terms of repayment agreed as per the loan agreement? 

"
740," As per the loan agreement, I had to repay the loan in 47 monthly instalments of Rs. 7,600 each, starting from 21.08.2018.

","Did you repay as per the terms of the agreement initially?

"
741," Yes, I paid 19 instalments regularly from August 2018 to March 2020 without any default. 

","You mentioned you are now facing some issues. Could you please elaborate what is the problem you are facing?

"
742," Due to the COVID-19 lockdown I was unable to operate my auto and earn anything from April 2020 to September 2020. Hence, I could not pay the EMIs for those 6 months. 

The company charged me Rs. 16,293 as interest for the lockdown period. On 24.09.2020 I paid Rs. 49,300 which included the 6 pending EMIs of Rs.7,600 each, lockdown interest of Rs. 16,293 and penal interest of Rs. 3,700. 

But they did not give proper credit for this payment. They just credited one EMI of Rs. 7,600 and the lockdown interest amount. The remaining amount they retained without any explanation.

","Okay, so the issue is regarding incorrect credit and retention of your payment made on 24.09.2020. Did you follow up with them on this?

"
743," Yes, when I got the statement of account in March 2022, I noticed they had arbitrarily increased the loan amount from Rs. 2,35,000 to Rs. 2,51,293 and also increased the number of EMIs from 47 to 51. When I asked them for an explanation, they did not give a proper response. They also refused to accept any further payment from me towards loan closure.

","When exactly did you receive this statement of account showing the increased loan amount and EMIs - could you please confirm the date?

"
744," I received the statement of account on 17.03.2022 from the finance company showing these unauthorised changes in my loan account.

","Thank you for providing these details. Just to summarise - you purchased the auto in August 2018, repaid regularly till March 2020, could not repay for 6 months during COVID lockdown, paid Rs. 49,300 on 24.09.2020 out of which full credit was not given, and on 17.03.2022 your statement reflected increased loan amount and number of EMIs. Please confirm if my understanding is correct. 

"
745," Yes, your understanding about the case is absolutely right. I paid my instalments on time initially but due to the lockdown I missed some payments. Even after I repaid the pending amount, they did not properly credit my account and later arbitrarily changed the loan details without any explanation.

","I understand sir. This summarises the key details of your grievance. Now I would like to know - did you send any formal legal notice to the finance company before planning to file a consumer complaint against them?

"
746," No, I have not sent the legal notice. 

","It is advised to send the legal notice to the opposite party before proceeding to file the complaint as sometimes you might be able to resolve the dispute without going to the consumer commission. 

"
747," Thanks for suggesting. Kindly draft a legal notice.

","I would request you to send the legal notice to the zonal office of the opposite party. Could you please provide the address for the same. 

"
748," The zonal office address is: 
The Manager, Zonal Office, Fortune Integrated Assets Limited, No.23, Sivaganga Road, Nungambakkam, Chennai - 600034.

","What relief would you like to seek from the opposite party? I would like to know briefly. 

"
749," I would like to seek a total of Rs. 2,10,000 - comprising Rs. 2 lakhs as compensation for mental agony and Rs. 10,000 as cost of the complaint proceedings. Apart from this I would like them to accept final settlement of the loan account on paying balance principal outstanding as per original terms of sanction.

","Here is the legal notice that you can send to both the opposite parties. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the state consumer helpline at 044-28592828 Call centre Assistants are available between 9-30 AM to 6-00 PM on all working days of Government of Tamil Nadu or you can call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints.

"
750," What if I don’t get any reply for this notice? What remedy do I have? 

","You can file a consumer complaint if your problem is not redressed. Do you want me to draft a complaint? 

"
751," Yes, draft a complaint for me. 

","According to the address that you have provided we can file the complaint at Virudhunagar , Madurai , Chennai. Which place do you prefer to file the complaint?

"
783," Yes, I did. When I protested and refused to pay the extra amount, they threatened not to deliver the motorcycle on the same day as promised. Feeling pressured, I reluctantly paid the amount and took delivery of the vehicle.
","That sounds like a frustrating situation. What happened next?
"
784," After taking delivery of the motorcycle, I approached Varun Motors again to request a refund of the extra amount they had charged me. They did return Rs. 2500 to me but claimed they were retaining Rs. 500 as handling charges. However, they hadn't done anything to justify these charges.
","That does seem unfair. Have you taken any steps to address this issue with Varun Motors?
"
785," Yes, I issued a legal notice to them, requesting the return of the extra amount they charged me. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any response from them.
","I see. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you have grounds to file a consumer complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, or you could also contact the respective State Consumer Helpline Number where you can talk to an agent and address your grievance. 
"
786," Could you provide me the helpline number
","To be specific, there is a National and State Consumer Helpline Number. Which number do you want me to provide you with.

","Thank you. And could you confirm the date of purchase of the motorcycle and the amount you paid?
"
790," I purchased the motorcycle on August 25, 2020, and I paid Rs. 1,42,458 for it.
","Perfect. Now, I'll need some information about Varun Motors for the complaint. Do you have their address and the name of their authorized signatory?
"
791," Yes, Varun Motors is located at D. No. 10-50-22/1, Siripuram Junction, Visakhapatnam-530003. Unfortunately, I don't have the name of their authorized signatory.
","That's okay, we can include a generic reference to their authorized representative in the complaint. Lastly, could you provide me with the dates of the refund and the legal notice you sent to Varun Motors?
"
792," Sure. Varun Motors refunded Rs. 2500 to me on August 31, 2020, and I issued the legal notice on September 5, 2020.
","Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are seeking for.
"
793,"  I would like to seek Rs.500/- collected towards handling charges, Rs.1,00,000/- towards compensation for the mental agony, Rs.1,00,000/- towards compensation for deficiency in service, Rs.10,000/- towards costs and any other relief which I am eligible for.

842,"  Almost immediately after the purchase. The engine would become too hot, the bike would fail to start, and it would frequently cut off while I was riding it.
","That sounds frustrating. What did you do when you noticed these issues?
"
843,"  I took the bike to Varun Motors' service center on 25th May 2018. Their mechanics inspected it and told me that the radiator fan assembly needed to be replaced to fix the problem.
","could you please clarify whether the defect was identified as a manufacturing defect after inspection. 
"
844," No.
","Could you please mention if the service was free or was covered under warranty or was it charged? 
"
845," Since it was immediately after purchase and considered as the first service it was done for free. However, I was charged for the service charges like labour charges, which was Rs. 5000. 
","Could you please mention, if you were provided with any benefits such as free service or free replacement at the time of purchase by the dealer.
"
846," I was provided with the benefit of free service for the first three services and free replacement of any part subject to being a manufacturing defect within one year from the date of purchase.
","Do you have receipts of the service charges.
"
847," Yes
","Did the replacement of the part resolve the issue.
"
848," Yes temporarily. But unfortunately, the problem persisted. I had to take the bike back to the service center on multiple occasions, and each time they replaced the radiator assembly, but the issue was never fully resolved.
","Could you mention how frequently the issue arises by specifying the dates.
"
849," After the first service, i.e on 25/05/2018, i went for the second time on 09/06/2018, again third time on 22/06/2018 again fourth time in the month of august 2018, again fifth in the month of sept 2018, the vehicle was stopped in the middle of journey near Sompeta, Srikakulam District and the complainant had to opt for roadside assistance. The service center sent the representatives from Visakhapatnam and took the same for carrying out repairs.
","Do you have receipts of each service.
"
850," Yes 
","Did you try to escalate the issue with the company?
"
851,"  Yes, I did. On 10th October 2018, I requested Varun Motors to have representatives from the company inspect the bike and either rectify the defect or replace the bike altogether. However, they only provided temporary repairs and returned the bike to me on 30th October 2018.
","And did this resolve the issue?
"
852,"  No, unfortunately not. The problems with the bike persisted, and I had to deal with constant breakdowns. Finally, on 12th January 2019, I sent a legal notice to the companies, but they didn't respond.
","Thank you for providing me with all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.
"
853," Firstly, I want the vehicle to be replaced. Because the vehicle is unfit to use irrespective of how many times it was repaired. Secondly, I would like to seek the costs of replacement (Service charges) for providing me with a defective vehicle and charging me for its repairs,  a total of Rs.1,50,000, almost costing me more than half the price of the vehicle. Further, the benefit of free service of the first three services to be extended because it was unnecessarily covered for the free replacement by the dealers. Also I would like to seek compensation of Rs.2,00,000 towards the negligent service and fraud. This is because I suspect the dealers deliberately concealed the fact that the defect was a manufacturing defect and withheld the benefit of free replacement and covered it under free service benefit. 
","Based on the above information provided you could file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, or you could also contact the respective State Consumer Helpline Number where you can talk to an agent and address your grievance.

"
879," Hi, I'm Mohammed Jahangir. I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding an issue I'm facing related to a property.

","I'll be happy to assist you with the consumer complaint. Can you explain the issue in detail? 

"
880," Sure. Here's the background - I had purchased a residential plot in Mahabubnagar back in 2009. It was Plot No. 73, total area 150 square yards, located at Sy Nos. 260, 263 and 264 at Christianpally Sivar. This plot was registered in my wife's name, Shaheda Begum. After purchasing the plot, I constructed a house on it using my retirement benefits. Since the plot was in my wife's name, I got the house constructed in her name too.

","What problem did you face ?

"
881," The house that I constructed on the plot was allotted a municipal door number - 14-4-154/3 by the local authorities. My wife Shaheda Begum unfortunately passed away in 2015. After her death, I was left as the legal heir of the house along with our son and 6 daughters. But when I approached the municipal authorities to get the house mutated to my name as legal heir, I found that the house was already mutated to my son's name without my knowledge and consent. 

","How did this mutation happen without your consent? Can you elaborate.

"
882," It turned out my son had submitted a fabricated gift deed to the municipal authorities, falsely stating that my wife had gifted the house to him before her death. This was completely false - my wife never made any such gift deed. It was forged by my son to illegally transfer the property.

","Right, that clarifies the key issue. Your son used fraudulent means to get the property mutated in his name. What steps did you take after you uncovered this?

"
883," I immediately approached the municipal authorities and pointed out the fabrication. I gave them my wife's death certificate and my legal heir certificate proving the mutation was done illegally. I followed up with them multiple times through written and oral complaints.But they didn't take  any action.

","I can assist you with drafting the consumer complaint highlighting your main grievance against the municipal authorities. But you also have the option to send  the legal notice to the opposite party. 

"
884," Please go ahead and draft the notice. I'll be able to review it and provide any additional inputs needed.

","Could you please send your address and the address of the opposite parties. 

"
885," My address is the same as already stated, S/o Mohammad Abdul Aziz, aged 69 years, H.No.14-4-154/3, Occupation: Retired govt employee, Shivashakthinagar,  Mahabubnagar town and district and the opposite parties address is 1. The Commissioner, Town Municipality, Mahabubnagar and 2.  Mohammad Mathin, 
S/o Mohammad Jahangir, aged 38 years, Occupation: Business, H.No.4-1-154/3, Shiva Shakthi Nagar, Mahabubnagar town and district.

","Here is the draft notice. Do you also want me to draft the complaint?

"
886," Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy. 

","Then you may file a consumer complaint. What remedy would you like to have from the consumer court. 

"
887," I would like to ask for cancellation of the transfer of property and recognise the complainant as a legal heir of Smt. Shaheda Begum and ask for appropriate compensation for mental agony and hardship suffered by the Complainant.

","With respect to the jurisdiction, as you the complainant is a retired employee and is resident of Mahabubnagar town it is well within the jurisdiction of District consumer forum Mahabubnagar. Commission. So the complaint will  be filed in Mahabubnagar. Kindly provide the information regarding the evidence that you have to back your case against  the other party. 

"
888," I have following proof to ascertain my claim, like, proof of construction of the house - this could include building permit records, property tax receipts etc. showing the house was constructed by you on the plot after purchase., Allotment letter from municipal authorities assigning door number 14-4-154/3 to the newly constructed house, legal heir certificate, mutation records from 2020 showing the property was mutated in your son's name, copy of the alleged fabricated gift deed, all written complaints made by you to the municipal authorities in 2020, death certificate of your wife Shaheda Begum

923," Hello Chatbot. I purchased an expensive digital keyboard for my daughter 3 years back for her music classes. But now I found that it is not suitable for higher grade exams as falsely claimed by the seller. I want to file a complaint and get compensation for this.

","I understand. Let us start from the beginning so I can gather all the details properly. Could you please confirm your name and address?

"
924," Sure, my name is D. Franklin Arul Stephen, Aged:45, Occupation: Pilot and I reside at D.No.413, Seminary Lane, Pasumalai, Madurai, Pincode 625002. 

","Thank you for providing your details Mr. Stephen. When exactly did you purchase this keyboard - please share the purchase date?

"
925," We purchased the Yamaha PSR I455 keyboard on 14th November 2013 from a musical instruments store called Honey Musical Instruments Gallery located at  No.201, Rajan complex,Madurai. We didn’t get the specifications that were promised.

","Okay. Could you please explain what exactly is the issue you faced with this Yamaha keyboard model PSR I455 purchased in November 2013?

"
926," My daughter was preparing for her Trinity College Music exams. The shop owner had told me at the time of purchase that this keyboard can be used for practicing and appearing for Trinity music exams up to Grade 8. My daughter used it successfully up to Grade 5 exams. But when she started preparing for the higher Grade 6 exam in 2016, her music teacher informed that this keyboard model does not have necessary features to be used for exams above Grade 5 due to lack of advanced options. I was very anxious to know this after spending 22,000 rupees on this keyboard based on the seller's assurances.

","I understand. Did you reach out to the manufacturer or seller regarding this discrepancy you faced?

"
927," Yes, when I learnt about this in 2016, I emailed Yamaha company who are the manufacturers of this keyboard on 27th May 2016 informing them about this false claim and deficiency in their PSR I455 model. However, they did not respond to my complaint. Then in February 2017, I sent them a legal notice asking for refund and suitable compensation. But still no response. I have copies of the email and legal notice sent to Yamaha company. The shop owner also did not help resolve this issue satisfactorily.

","Okay. Please share more details about the Yamaha company who manufactured this keyboard and the music instruments shop and owner who sold this to you.

"
928," The keyboard was manufactured by Yamaha Music India Pvt. Ltd. which is a leading musical instruments brand in India. Their head office address is P-401, JMD Mega Poils, Sector 48, Sohna Road, Gurgaon, Haryana - 122018. I purchased it from a shop named Honey Musical Instruments Gallery located at Shop No. 201, Rajan Complex, Tamil Sangam Road, Madurai. The shop owner's name is Mr. Raghav Sharma.

","Thank you for providing the specific details. Just to confirm, have you retained the original purchase invoice and warranty card for this keyboard?

"
929," Yes, I have the original cash memo dated 14th Nov 2013 from Honey Musical Instruments shop showing the purchase details. I also have the warranty card and some promotional pamphlets which came with the keyboard which mentions it can be used for Trinity exams of all grades.

","That is very helpful. Please keep those documents safely as proof. Can you share what resolution you are expecting now from Yamaha company and the musical shop to address your grievance?

"
930," As the keyboard is unsuitable for my daughter's music education needs above Grade 5 contrary to their assurances, I had asked them for a refund of the purchase amount I paid. I also incurred further expenses to buy a new advanced keyboard. All this has caused immense harassment and loss. I expect a suitable compensation amount for the same along with the cost for my legal expenses. I would also appreciate it if they can replace this faulty keyboard with a suitable model that can actually be used uptil Grade 8 exams as assured.

","Your expectations seem reasonable. But I need some additional information before I proceed to draft a consumer complaint. Where would you like to file the complaint: Gurgaon or Madurai. 

"
931," I would like to file the complaint at Madurai.

","Thank you. I have drafted a pre-filled complaint that you can access here. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature.

"
950," Hello, I am Veer Pal Singh, and I am from Punjab. I became a member of Ford Club Travel Pleasure, and I have an issue with a recent tour booking to Dubai.
","I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Singh. Can you provide more details about the issue that you faced with the Dubai tour booking?
"
951,"  I booked a Dubai tour for 4 nights and 5 days through Ford Club Travel Pleasure. As a member, I was told that the five-star hotel stay was free. I paid for my membership in installments, which is about 1,90,000 Rs. and also booked flight tickets separately for Rs. 39,487. However, after a few days, I received a call saying the booking in the five-star hotel was canceled, and I had to pay an additional Rs. 18,000 for a booking in that same hotel. I paid the amount, but upon reaching Dubai, I found out that the hotel was not a five-star facility as promised. It was of very low quality.
","I am sorry for the inconvenience you've faced. To assist you better, can you provide additional details regarding the benefits you were promised to get after becoming a member and the amount that you paid in membership fee?
"
952," The membership cost me 1,90,000 Rs. The membership promised me premium tourism in places like Dubai that are popular for tourism at discounted rates, but they did the opposite of that after my booking.
","Got it. Now can you tell me the date you booked the Dubai tour and the mode of payment, the date when you paid the additional amount of 18,000 Rs., the days you spent in Dubai, the name of the five-star hotel which they promised to book for you, the name of the hotel in which you ultimately stayed and any communication you had with Ford Club after the tour?
"
953," The booking happened on 1st March by going to their website and by paying using a bank transfer. I paid the additional amount on 10.3.2022. The tour was from 24.3.2022 to 28.3.2022. I was told that the booking would happen at Movenpick Hotel and Apartment, Bur Dubai but the booking happened at ABC Hotel. After the tour, I contacted Ford Club several times but they refused to accept their fault. They do not have a specialized customer care service. 

","Thank you for providing those details. Do you have any emails or messages exchanged between you and Ford Club regarding the additional payment of 18,000 Rs., any pictures that were taken of the hotel, and any communication exchanged after the tour? 
"
954," Yes, I do have emails and WhatsApp messages that I sent to Ford Club. I also have pictures of the hotel. The emails and WhatsApp messages are about how the hotel was of low quality. They also include my requests for a refund.
","Thank you. Based on what you've told me, it seems there's a discrepancy between the promised five-star hotel and the actual accommodation. This indicates a deficiency in service from Ford Club. You have a legitimate grievance for which you can seek redressal, i.e. remedy. Let me know what kind of remedy you are seeking and how much you want for the same.
"
955," I want a refund and compensation for mental agony. For mental agony, I think 1,00,000 Rs. will be right. I paid 2,47,487 Rs. in total, including the membership fees. 
","In order to get the relief that you are seeking, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Forum which has jurisdiction to hear your case. You can also go for mediation or contact the Punjab State Consumer Helpline to assist you in this regard. You can find the helpline number here. Please feel free to ask me for any clarifications regarding each of the options I have presented to you. 
"
956," What will happen if I call the state consumer helpline?
","The Punjab State Consumer Helpline will hear your grievance and will guide you by providing the steps involved in filing a case. They will also render advice regarding the strength of your case. 
"
957," What about mediation?
","mediation is a form of settling disputes outside courts. In mediation, neutral third persons called mediators assist the parties in arriving at an amicable settlement. The mediators cannot decide the case but can only aim for an amicable settlement between the parties. If the parties do not agree to a settlement, then the mediation process comes to an end, resulting in the parties having to seek other methods of settling their dispute, including going to court.
"
958," I would like to go to court. 
","Got it. Before you file a complaint before the forum, you would have to send a fifteen-day notice to Ford Club Travel Pleasure. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, or if you do not receive a response from them after a period of fifteen days, you can initiate legal action by approaching the consumer court. Do you want me to draft a notice for you?
"
959," Yes, it will be nice if you can draft a notice.
","In that case, I would me needing some more information. Can you provide me with your full name and address? 
"
960," My full name is Veer Pal Singh, son of Balwinder Singh. I live in Viskarma Mohalla, Amritsar Road, Kot Ise Khan, Tehsil Dharamkot District, Moga. 
","Thank you. Additionally, I would require details such as the full name and address of Ford Club, the Booking ID for the tour to Dubai, the details of the flight tickets that you booked, and your Membership Number. Or else, you can upload the flight tickets, the booking-related documents, and your membership ID here.
"
961," The full name of Ford Club is Ford Club Travel Pleasure and the address of the sales office is Plot No. 738, JLPL Industrial Estate, Sector-82, Mohali, India-160055. 
(upon uploading the documents)
","In the notice, the opposite party must be directed to give you the relief that you are seeking. Here, you are seeking a refund along with compensation for mental agony. Is it okay if the notice directs Ford Club to initiate the refund amount and payment of compensation for mental agony within a period of fifteen days? This is because the period of the notice is for fifteen days. 
"
962," Yes, I do not mind that. 
","Thank you. I now require details regarding whether you want to send Ford Club the notice physically or via email. If you want to send it via email, please provide me with the email ID that can be used by Ford Club if they want to send a reply. What would you prefer?
"
963," I prefer email. You can use my email address: singh@gmail.com
</s> <s><INST> Thank you. You can access the notice here. Please keep in mind that your signature is required in the notice. You can either take a printout of the notice and sign it, or else you can e-sign it. Also mention the date in the notice before you send it.

Do you want me to guide you on how you can file a complaint?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I will sign it before I send it. I will also put the date. Can you please provide me with the steps on how I can file a complaint before the consumer forum?
","First, I would have to determine which consumer forum has the jurisdiction, i.e., the authority to hear your case. You are residing in Moga, but Ford Club’s Office is in Mohali. Due to this, you can file a complaint in either the consumer court in Moga or in Mohali. Which option do you prefer?
"
964," Since I live in Moga, it is better if the court in Moga deals with the matter. 
","Got it. In that case, you can file your complaint before the Moga District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum. Do you want me to draft a pre-filled complaint that you can use?
"
965," Yes, it would be great if you could draft a complaint that I can use.
","In that case, I will be requiring some documents that will be used as evidence. Since you have already provided the flight tickets, the booking-related documents, and your membership ID, you just need to give me proof of the additional payment of 18,000 Rs. I would also require your father’s name, your age, and your occupation. You can upload that here.
(Upon uploading)
"
966," My father’s name is Balwinder Singh. I am 36 years old and I am a software developer.
","Thank you. You can access the pre-filled complaint here. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?

However, if the parties do not arrive at an amicable settlement, the matter is sent back to the court.
"
970," Got it. I will not agree for mediation.
","In that case, the consumer court in Moga has to proceed with the case.
"
971," Got it. Thank you very much!
","You are welcome. Feel free to raise further queries anytime. Best wishes.

"
972," Hello Chatbot. I purchased some silver jewellery from a shop recently but I faced some issues regarding deduction of weight and purity of the products. I want to file a consumer complaint in the consumer court but need help understanding the process.

","Sure, I would be happy to guide you through the entire process. But first, let me understand the full details of what happened. When did you make this jewellery purchase and give a description of the purchase? 

"
973," I purchased 2 pairs of silver leg chains and 2 pairs of silver metti tags on 1st January 2022 from Lalitha Jewellery Mart in Madurai. The total bill amount was Rs. 11,013.

","Okay. And from the options, I show below, what best describes how you made the payment for this purchase?

1. Full payment in cash 
2. Part cash, part old jewellery exchange
3. Full old jewellery exchange

"
974," I did part payment in cash and part by exchange of my old silver chain. 

","Understood. Could you please confirm your name, age and full residential address? This is required from a jurisdiction perspective when filing the case.

"
975," My name is V. Ramaraj, age 48 years, residing at Pasumpon Nagar, Madurai.

","Thanks for confirming. So you exchanged an old silver chain while purchasing the new jewellery on 1st Jan 2022. What was the net weight of this old chain? 

"
976," The old silver chain weighed approximately 201 grams which I had purchased from the same Lalitha Jewellery shop about 1 year back.

","Okay. And what was the issue you faced during this exchange? Please explain the problem in detail.

"
977," As per standard market practice, while exchanging old silver items, shops deduct some weight for wastage and pay as per latest market rate for remaining net weight. In my case, when valuing the 201 grams old silver chain for exchange, the shop should have deducted 4 grams for dust wastage which is reasonable. But apart from 4 grams they also deducted 59 grams over and above this claiming it as processing wastage charges. So they calculated the exchange value only for the remaining 138 grams instead of at least 197 grams (201 grams - 4 grams dust charges). This 59 grams deduction was very unreasonable and resulted in financial loss to me.

","According to you this 59 grams deduction is beyond normal standards and unacceptable?

"
978," Yes, absolutely! As a consumer, I felt cheated. The silver jewellery that is 201 grams was brought from the same shop and I paid for the full 201 grams so when I exchanged it I should have got an appropriate return on the exchanged silver. 

","Noted. Usually 5-10% is the max wastage deduction, not 30%. I should have got a value of at least 197 grams after allowing 4 grams for dust. We have the option to send a legal notice and file a consumer complaint.

"
979," I also have another issue related to the same transaction.

","Please elaborate in detail.

"
980," Yes, another problem I faced was that the 190 grams new silver leg chain I purchased as part of this purchase broke in just a few days! It looks like the new silver chain given to me was made of impure silver. 

","I understand. We can send the legal notice or file a complaint for both the issues as they are part of the same transaction.

"
981,"kindly draft legal notice and the complaint. 

","Can you please confirm your occupation and address

"
982," V.Ramaraj, S/o. Varadarajulu, Age-45, Occupation: Sub-inspector, r/o Pasumpon Nagar, Madurai.

","Can you please confirm the opposite party's address.

"
983,"Lalitha Jewellery Mart Private Limited, No.180-182,South Masi Street, Madurai - 1





","As both the parties reside in Madurai, the district consumer redressal commission Madurai will have the jurisdiction to try the case. 
What remedy would you like to seek from the court, like replacement of impure silver or compensation or both?

"
984," I want compensation for the 59 grams of silver, for which the payment was not made. Further I want compensation of 5 lakh for causing stress and mental agony.

","Thankyou. Kindly share the document that could be helpful to draft the complaint and notice. 

"
985," I have uploaded the receipts of transactions.

"
1057," Hi, I need help filing a complaint against an insurance company that has rejected my husband's accident insurance claim. 

","Could you please explain the complete details about the problem you faced?

"
1058," Sure. My name is Katta Amrutha. My late husband Katta Shekhar Reddy had taken an insurance policy for his two-wheeler from Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company. It was policy number 3397/00127036/000/00 which he had taken in June 2019. The policy provided accident cover of Rs 15 lakhs in case of death of the insured. It was for the time period from 06/06/2019 to 05/06/2024.

","Could you now please walk me through what happened after he took this policy? 

"
1059," My husband met with a motorcycle accident on 10th May 2020. He suffered serious injuries in the accident and passed away the same day. As his wife and nominee, I submitted the accident insurance claim to Cholamandalam MS Insurance on 5th June 2020, providing all documents. But they have illegally rejected my claim.

","Okay. Did they give any reasons for claim rejection? 

"
1060," They arbitrarily said that it was not an accidental death but due to heart attack, which is completely false. The police report and the inquest report clearly shows he died due to accident injuries.

","could you please share what steps you have taken after they rejected your claim? Have you approached them again?

"
1061," Yes, after their initial rejection I have written many emails and made countless calls to their customer care requesting them to review and settle my claim. But they are just giving me pointless excuses. No one is addressing my grievance.

","I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Could you please confirm if you have filed a formal complaint with the insurance company's grievance redressal department along with supporting documents? 

"
1062," Yes I filed the formal complaint with their grievance department on 05/06/2020, attaching all documents. But they simply sent a meaningless reply rejecting it again without any reason.I have no other option now but to seek external help. 

","Have you sent any legal notice after rejection of the complaint  from the company's grievance redressal department. 

"
1063," Yes. I have sent a legal notice on 12-10-2020. I would like to file a complaint now.

","Thank you for giving me the full sequence of events. I could assist you in drafting a complaint. Would you like me to generate one for you?

"
1064," Yes. It would be really helpful.

","In order to draft a complaint I need some other details like the address of the parties based on that I would also recommend a jurisdiction in which the complaint can be filed.
"
1065,"With respect to the address, specify my address as Smt. Katta Amrutha W/o Late Shekhar Reddy, Aged 40 years, Occupation: Housewife, Resident of MIG-21, Housing Board Colony,  Mahabubnagar, Mahabubnagar District - 509001 and the opposite party address as The Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited, Represented by its Branch Manager, #1-2-73/2 & 1-2-63 to 64, No.302, 3rd Floor, SR Arcade, Parklane, Above Bank of Baroda, Secunderabad, Hyderabad - 500 001.

","Thanks for sharing the address. In the present case for the issue of jurisdiction, the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar and Hyderabad will have jurisdiction as the complainant has residence at Mahabubnagar and the opposite party has registered office in Hyderabad. Which jurisdiction would you prefer? I think you should go for the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar as it is your place of residence and therefore  would be convenient for you. 

"
1066," Yes, the jurisdiction of District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar would work fine for me. 
","Could you please tell what relief you expect from the court, do you want your vehicle back or do you need your money as compensation for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party. 
"
1067," In terms of remedy I would like to have a compensation amount of Rs.15,00,000/- covered under the Policy and Rs.15,000/- towards compensation for mental agony and Rs. 10,000 as cost of the complaint. 

","Thank you for the confirmation, I will draft the initial consumer complaint and share it with you soon for your review. Please feel free to suggest any changes or additions as required. In the meantime, you may share a copy of the policy document, claim rejection letter, police report, inquest  report  and other relevant documents. This will help me represent the facts better. Let me know if you need any other assistance.

"
1068," I have uploaded all the documents:
","Thank you. On the basis of the documents that you have given me, and the complaint that you can access here. Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?

1092," Hello, I am the proprietor of Sharma Superstore and I am from Moga, Punjab. I purchased an AC from Home Solutions for my shop. The AC, since the first day, has not been cooling properly. I informed the customer care service and they told me that the AC did not have gas. After getting the AC filled with gas the problems have continued and Home Solutions has not sent a technician despite telling me that they will. What do I do?
","I am sorry for what you have gone through. Can you give me additional details regarding the date you purchased the Air Conditioner, its cost, and its model?
"
1093,"  I bought the AC on 13th August 2021. It is an IFB AC that is 1.5 tons. It cost me 36,000 Rs. On 22nd April 2022. 
","Thank you so much. please confirm when you were informed that the Air Conditioner did not have gas and what the technicians told you the last time they checked the Air Conditioner.
"
1094," I was told by the technicians that there was no gas. After filling the AC with gas, it worked for a while and then started causing issues again. The last time the technicians came, they told me that the AC had a microleakage problem. 
","After you were informed that there is a microleakage issue, did the technicians tell you that they will get the same rectified?
"
1095," Yes, they said that they would get it fixed. They have not sent anyone since then. I have made a customer care complaint and that has been of no use.
","To whom did you make the customer care complaint?
"
1096," I made it to both Home Solutions and IFB and I also have their acknowledgement of the same. 
","Have you contacted Home Solutions and IFB since then to request them to get the AC fixed?
"
1097," Yes, I have contacted them several times but they have not responded. 
","Based on what you have told me, you have been given a defective Air Conditioner. Further, since they have not responded properly to your requests and have not rectified the microleakage problem, there is also a deficiency of service. For this, you can seek redressal, i.e., relief from Home Solutions, which has sold the AC to you, and also from IFB Industries, whose AC is defective.  Let me know what kind of remedy you are seeking and how much you want for the same.
"
1098," I want a replacement along with compensation for mental agony and litigation expenses. For mental agony, I think 50,000 Rs. is reasonable. 
","In order to get the relief that you are seeking, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Forum which has jurisdiction to hear your case. You can also go for mediation or contact the Punjab State Consumer Helpline to assist you in this regard. You can find the contact number of the Punjab State Consumer Helpline here. Please feel free to ask me for any clarifications regarding each of the options I have presented to you.  
"
1099," What will happen if I call the state consumer helpline?
","The Punjab State Consumer Helpline will hear your grievance and will guide you by providing the steps involved in filing a case. They will also render advice regarding the strength of your case. 
"
1100," What about mediation?
","mediation is a form of settling disputes outside courts. In mediation, neutral third persons called mediators assist the parties in arriving at an amicable settlement. The mediators cannot decide the case but can only aim for an amicable settlement between the parties. If the parties do not agree for a settlement, then the mediation process comes to an end, resulting in the parties having to seek other methods of settling their dispute, including going to court.
Aggrieved Consumer; What is the guarantee that Home Solutions and IFB will come for an amicable settlement?
</INST> It is difficult to predict if Home Solutions and IFB will come for a settlement. The same depends on the mediation process and the terms and conditions that are placed by both sides for settlement. While there is a chance that there will be an amicable settlement based on the terms you are seeking, there is no guarantee for the same.
"
1101," If there is no guarantee, then I want to file a complaint before the Consumer Forum. 
","Got it. Before you file a complaint before the forum, you would have to send a fifteen-day notice to Home Solutions and IFB. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, or if you do not receive a response from them after a period of fifteen days, you can initiate legal action by approaching the consumer court. Do you want me to draft a notice for you?
"
1102," Yes, it will be nice if you can draft a notice.
","In that case, I require additional details such as your full name, address, and contact details. 
"
1103," My name is Gurdarshan Sharma, and I reside in Ward No. 27, Jalandhar Colony, Kotkapura Road, Moga. My father’s name is Jagdish Rai. My phone number is 7894232566. 
","additionally, can you confirm the full name and address of Home Solutions and the full name of IFB Industries and its address? I also require the Invoice number and the other particulars of the purchase. Or else, you can upload the invoice here.  
"
1104," The full name of Home Solutions is Home Solutions Street. Address- No.9, New Town, Opposite Dharamshala Lal Chand, Moga. IFB Industries Limited (Home Appliances Division), L 1, Verna Electronic City, Verna, Salcete, Goa, 403722. 
(upon uploading the invoice)
","Thank you. The notice must specify the relief that you are seeking. Here, you are seeking a replacement for the Air Conditioner along with compensation for mental agony. Is it okay if the notice directs the initiation of the replacement and the payment of compensation for mental agony within fifteen days of the opposite party receiving it? This is because the period of the notice is fifteen days. 
"
1105," Yes, that is not an issue at all. 
","Thank you. Do you want to send the notice electronically or by post? I would require your address if you want to send a physical copy, or your email ID if you want to send the notice electronically. The email ID that you gave me can be used by Home Solutions and IFB Industries if they want to send a reply.
"
1106," I want to send it by email. Their response can also be via email.
","If that is the case, kindly give me the email address to which you want them to send a reply.
"
1107," abc@gmail.com
","Based on the information you have provided me, you can find the notice here. Please keep in mind that your signature is required in the notice. You can either take a printout of the notice and sign it, or else you can e-sign it. Also mention the date in the notice before you send it. If you do not get a satisfactory response or if you do not get a response within fifteen days, you can file a complaint before the consumer forum. Do you want me to guide you on how you can file a complaint before the consumer forum?
Aggrieved Consumer; Yes, please provide me with the steps on how I can file a complaint before the consumer forum.
</INST> First, I would have to determine which consumer forum has the jurisdiction, i.e., the authority to hear your case. The court can be identified on the basis of the location where either Home Solutions and IFB Industries or any of its branches are situated, or where you are residing or working. Here, you and Home Solutions are situated in Moga, while IFB Industries’ Office is in Goa. Due to this, you can either file your complaint before the consumer forum in Moga or in Goa. Which consumer forum do you prefer?
"
1108," I prefer Moga.
","Got it. In that case, do you want me to draft a pre-filled complaint that you can use?
"
1109," Yes, it will be great if you can draft a complaint which I can use.
","Great! In addition to the invoice that you have already given me, do you have any other documents to prove that there was deficiency of service.  Any messages exchanged between you and the opposite parties about getting the AC repaired and any proof that you made a customer care complaint is sufficient for the same.
"
1110," Yes, I have messages that I sent to Home Solutions and to IFB saying that the AC is defective. I also have their response saying that they will send a technician to repair the micro leakage problem. I also have the customer care complaint and their acknowledgement
","Great, you can attach the messages, the invoice and the customer care complaint with its acknowledgement here.

"
1115," Hi . I need help with filing a consumer complaint against a chit fund operator who has not paid me my due amount. 

","Okay, Could you please start by telling me your name and some basic details about yourself?

"
1116," Sure. My name is A. Balavardhan Reddy, son of A. Ram Reddy. I am 35 years old and work as a private employee. I reside at House Number 1-21, Yellareddypalle village, Koilkonda mandal, Mahabubnagar district.

","Thank you for providing those details Mr. Balavardhan Reddy. Now, can you please explain to me in detail  about the chit fund issue you are facing? 

"
1117," The chit fund operator is an individual named S. Govardhan Reddy, son of Narayan Reddy. He is around 53 years old and runs this business in Mahabubnagar district. He currently resides in Hyderabad after shifting from his native place. Actually, Govardhan Reddy and I are distant relatives. When he started this chit fund scheme in Mahabubnagar in 2015, he approached me and requested that I join as a chit member since he knew me. It is an unregistered chit fund operation.

","What was the total chit value you opted for and what were the terms regarding duration, instalments, commission etc?

"
1118," I joined the chit fund in October 2015 when it commenced. The total chit value I opted for was Rs 5,00,000. It was scheduled to run for 25 months, so my monthly subscription amount was Rs 20,000. As per the terms, 5% commission would be deducted from the chit amount. 

","Were any written documents or agreements executed between you and Mr. Govardhan Reddy regarding this chit fund? 

"
1119," No, nothing in writing was made. Everything was on trust and verbal agreement since we knew each other. But he did issue receipts in my name for all the monthly payments I made. 

","Okay, the receipts will help prove your case. For how long did you continue paying the monthly subscriptions? When did you stop?

"
1120," I paid the Rs 20,000 every month diligently for the entire duration of 25 months till October 2017 when the chit fund cycle was supposed to end. I was the last member in this chit.

","What happened after you completed all the 25 month payments? Did you receive your chit amount from Mr. Govardhan Reddy? 

"
1121," No, that is the issue. After I paid the entire amount, I approached him multiple times asking to pay me my chit amount of Rs 4,75,000 (after deducting his 5% commission). But he kept delaying and postponing on some pretext or the other.

","I understand. Can you please elaborate what excuses he gave for not paying your amount and how many months this went on?
"
1122," He first said he has to manage finances for his daughter's wedding. Then over the next 2 years, he gave some reason or the other - financial constraints, bank delays, etc. In total, he did not pay me for almost 3 years after the chit fund ended. I approached him many times from November 2017 to August 2020 for my chit amount.

","That is a very long delay. What finally transpired in August 2020 after 3 years of chasing him? Were you able to recover your hard earned money?

"
1123," In August 2020, I pressured him a lot and he finally agreed to execute a promissory note. He gave this written promise that he will pay the chit amount of Rs 4,75,000 along with interest at 24% per annum from November 2017 till August 2020. The total amount he promised in the promissory note was Rs 7,50,000.

","Okay, so you have this promissory note from August 2020. Further what happened.

"
1124," As per the note, he said he will pay me in 3 months, but 3 months passed and he kept dodging. This continued for another few months despite my regular follow-ups. Finally in December 2020 he stopped responding to me. I lost hope of recovering my money. I have now decided to take legal recourse by filing a formal complaint against him with your assistance.

","I will certainly help you file an effective consumer complaint. Before that, do you have the promissory note given by Mr. Govardhan Reddy in August 2020? And the receipts of your 25 monthly payments? This will be important evidence.

"
1125," Yes I have both. I have kept them safely ready. 

","Wonderful, that documentation will make your case very strong. Can you confirm that this entire chit fund business of Mr. Govardhan Reddy is unregistered and informal? There are no company documents?

"
1126," Yes, absolutely. It is an unregistered, informal business. There are no company registration papers or anything like that. Just my receipts and his note. 

","Have you sent any legal notice to the opposite party? If not, I would  recommend you send one legal notice to the opposite party. 

"
1127," I have not sent any legal notice to the opposite party. Kindly, draft a legal notice and the consumer complaint. 

","Here is the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

"
1128,"</s> <s><INST> Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy. Then I will need to file a consumer complaint. 

","Yes, then you may file a consumer complaint. Do you want me to draft a complaint?

"
1129," Yes, Kindly draft a consumer complaint.

","Sure, I would draft the complaint. But for this I need some additional information, like name of the parties, your name and the name of the opposite party, age, occupation, address based on that I would also recommend a jurisdiction in which the complaint can be filed.

As advised, on 12th Feb 2019, I shipped the product from the Mahabubnagar post office to Amazon's warehouse in Gurgaon, Haryana. It was registered parcel number CA012164954IN and I paid ₹650 postal charges.Even after 2-3 weeks, the tracking status still showed that the parcel was in transit. So I started following up with the post office repeatedly to trace it but there was no proper response.

","I understand. What was the final update you received about your parcel? Did you get any written communication from the post office about it?

"
1183," After almost 6 months of me persistently following up, the Mahabubnagar post office finally sent me a letter saying my parcel was received in Gurgaon sorting facility but then they lost track of it and couldn't trace it anymore.

","That must have been very frustrating for you. Did the post office offer any compensation or resolution for losing your parcel?

"
1184," Yes, in their letter dated 23rd September 2019, they said they were closing the case and offered me Rs. 500 as goodwill compensation. I refused to accept it since the toy car was worth ₹12,499. This is totally unfair.

","You're absolutely right. Losing a customer's package is a deficiency in service. Did you take up this issue further with higher authorities in the postal department?

"
1185," I complained to the senior officials through their public grievance portal. But other than sympathising, they also did not offer any resolution. 

","It would be good to send a legal notice to the opposite party. Maybe you get the remedy that you were looking for.

"
1186," Kindly draft a legal  notice. 
","Here is the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party and ask for the sum of Rs. 12,499/- towards the cost of the toy car sent through the registered post and pay Rs.2000 towards the notice. If this also does not work you can look go forward to file a consumer complaint against the opposite party.In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the state consumer helpline at 1800-425-00333 Call centre Assistants are available between 9-30 AM to 6-00 PM on all working days of Government of Telangana or you can call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

"
1187," Please draft a consumer complaint as given the conduct of the opposite party I don't have much hope that the opposite party would give me proper redressal. 

","You have come to the right place, I would draft the complaint. But for this I need some additional information, like the name of the parties, your name and the name of the opposite party, age, occupation, address. In the present case we should make the post office and amazon as the opposite parties. Based on that I would also recommend a jurisdiction in which the complaint can be filed.

1256," Hello Chatbot. I recently had a very unpleasant experience while travelling on an international flight and lost my luggage. The airline has failed to find or compensate me for it even after months of followup. I want to file a consumer complaint in the consumer court against the airline but need help drafting it. Can you guide me through the process?

","Absolutely, I'm happy to help. Let's start by gathering all the relevant details so I can understand the full context before we proceed to drafting the complaint. Could you please confirm your name and address.

"
1257," My name is A. Sivanupandian, Age: 35, Occupation: Teacher and I reside at D.No.136, North Street, Sinkikulam, Nanguneri Taluk, Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu.

","Thank you for providing your details Mr. Sivanupandian. Could you please tell me the name of the airline you travelled with and details about your trip - like date of travel, flight number, departure city, destination city etc? This will help establish the basic facts.

"
1258," I travelled from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Madurai, India on 15th August 2017 on Srilankan Airlines flight UL139. My ticket details are E-ticket no. 6034996832446, Seat no. 29E.

","Got it. Let's now discuss the issue you faced. You mentioned your luggage was lost - could you provide more details like how many bags were checked-in, what they contained, their approximate value etc? Also, when and how did you realise the bags were missing?

"
1259," I had checked in one bag weighing around 8kgs during departure at Colombo airport. It contained clothes, dry fruits, chocolates, dry fish, honey and other food items that I had purchased as gifts for family and friends during my Sri Lanka tour. The total value of the contents would be around Rs. 2 lakhs. When I arrived at Madurai airport after landing, I waited at the belt for over 2 hours but my bag never came. That's when I understood it was lost.
","Thank you for the details. What steps did you take after realising your bag was missing? Did you approach the airline staff and file any complaint or report?

"
1260," Yes, I immediately informed the airport authorities and also the Srilankan Airlines staff about my missing bag. They said they would search but could not find it. The airline staff gave me a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) to list the contents of my lost bag and record the incident.

","Good, the PIR will serve as an important proof of your lost bag. What follow ups did you do with the airline after that? It has been several months so I'm assuming you tried contacting them again?

"
1261," I sent multiple emails on 17th Aug, 18th Aug and 20th Sept 2017 to follow up on my missing bag but the airline did not give any proper response. 

","I understand this must have been very frustrating for you. Could you please confirm the registered office address of Srilankan Airlines in Madurai that I should mention in the complaint?

"
1262," The airline office is located at Madurai Airport itself. I had booked the flight tickets directly via their website around 1 month before travel in July 2017.

","In that case I suggest you send the legal notice and try to get a settlement with the opposing party. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the state consumer helpline at 044-28592828 Call centre Assistants are available between 9-30 AM to 6-00 PM on all working days of Government of Tamil Nadu or you can call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints.

"
1263," What if I don’t get any reply for this notice? What remedy do I have? 

","You can file a consumer complaint if your problem is not redressed. Do you want me to draft a complaint? 

"
1264," Yes, draft a complaint  for me. 

","For drafting a complaint I would need some additional information. As the value of your lost items is approximately Rs. 2 lakhs, your complaint would fall under the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. You can choose between the two districts Tirunelveli and Madurai. Which district do you prefer?

"
1265," I would like to file the complaint at Madurai. 

","What relief would you like to get from the opposite party? 

"
1266," I would like to ask for a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- towards the value of the lost baggage and contents thereof and a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- towards compensation for mental agony, harassment caused to the Complainant.

"

"
1301," Yes, the motor pump set was under a warranty period of 1 year from the date of purchase. I have the original purchase invoice, - the invoice is numbered 45621 dated 23/09/2020.

"
1302," The motor pump set worked fine initially. But within a few months of purchase, it started giving some problems. It would make loud noises and eventually stopped working completely after some time. Since it was within the 1 year warranty period, I wanted to get it repaired by the dealer under warranty.

","Okay. Did you contact the dealer regarding this?

"
1303," Yes, I approached the dealer and requested them to repair it under warranty. They asked me to send the motor to them and they would repair and return it. But  the motor got  damaged in transit. 

","Alright. Can you please explain how you sent the defective motor pump set to the dealer? 

"
1304," For transporting the motor pump set, I used a transportation company named Navata Road Transport. On 22nd January 2021, I booked the item through them and sent it to the dealer for repairs.

","I see. Please provide more details about Navata Road Transport - their address, waybill number etc. Also, how much value did you declare for the motor pump set while booking the transportation?

"
1305," Navata Road Transport is located in Nagarkurnool, their main office address is Door No. 18-667, Bose Buildings, Kanuru, Vijayawada. I booked the item via their Nagarkurnool branch. The waybill number is SO94101-1 dated 22/01/2021. As for declared value, I specified Rs. 5,000 while booking the transportation through them.

","Thank you for the transportation details. You mentioned the motor pump set reached the dealer in a damaged condition. Can you please elaborate what kind of damage had occurred?

"
1306," Yes, when the motor pump reached the dealer, it was completely damaged. The base and body were bent and crushed, the terminal plate was broken, and the motor was in completely unrepairable condition. The dealer informed me that due to the extensive transit damage, they cannot accept or repair it under warranty.

","Did you follow up with Navata Road Transport regarding this damage? 

"
1307," I immediately contacted Navata Road Transport and questioned them about how the motor was damaged so badly during transit. But they did not give any satisfactory response regarding this. They also refused to take any responsibility for the damage.

","What did Navata Road Transport convey when you contacted them? Did they inspect the damaged motor pump set?

"
1308," When I called them and complained, they simply denied any liability. They insisted the motor pump was in fine condition when transported and refused to even inspect the damaged item. I got no proper response despite multiple complaints to Navata Road Transport.

","In this scenario, did you take up this issue with the dealer as well?

"
1309," Yes, I informed the dealer Balaji Agricultural Agencies about how the motor was damaged during transit by Navata Road Transport. I requested them to address this issue and arrange for repairs under warranty as promised. However, they also refused to take any responsibility in the matter.

","Alright, so neither the transportation company nor the dealer were helpful in getting this resolved. Can you summarise the loss you have incurred due to this damaged motor pump set?

"
1310," Due to the motor being damaged, I have suffered a huge loss. Firstly, I have lost the cost of the motor pump set itself, which is Rs. 20,750 that I spent to purchase it. Secondly, I have not been able to carry out agricultural activities properly without the motor pump set, leading to production losses. I estimate the production losses to be around Rs. 1 lakh.

","Thank you for patiently providing the full details. Given the facts of the case, I would recommend sending a legal notice to both the transport company Navata Road Transport and the dealer Balaji Agricultural Agencies under the Consumer Protection Act 2019. I can assist you in drafting the complaint. Would you like me to proceed with preparing a draft consumer complaint?

"
1311," Yes please, I would like you to draft the consumer complaint on my behalf against both the transporter and dealer to seek compensation for my losses. Please include all the relevant details we discussed.
","Kindly share your address.
