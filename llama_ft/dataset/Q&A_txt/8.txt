Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User: I have an issue regarding my late husband's insurance policy with Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd. 
Chatbot: Could you please provide me with some more details regarding the matter?
User:  Certainly. My husband was approached by an agent from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd. on 20th February 2020, who convinced him to buy a health insurance policy. After some discussions, my husband agreed, and on 2nd March 2020, the agent collected Rs. 2,00,000 from us and issued the policy.
Chatbot: Do you have any documentation regarding the policy?
User: : Yes, we have the policy document. 
Chatbot: Thank you. Now, could you tell me what happened later.
User: My husband fell ill and was admitted to Apollo Hospital with Covid-19 pneumonia on 13th September 2020, we informed the insurance company about the situation and requested a claim form.
Chatbot: And did they provide you with the necessary information and forms?
User:  No, unfortunately, they didn't respond to our request.
Chatbot: I see. What steps did you take after that?
User: : We wrote a letter to the insurance company on 15th March 2021, asking them to settle the claim, but still received no response.
Chatbot: And did you take any further action?
User:  Yes, we sent a registered legal notice to the company on 14th December 2021, but once again, they did not reply.
Chatbot: I understand. Did you receive any communication from the insurance company during this time?
User: We didn't receive any response to our letters or legal notice. However, upon checking my father's bank statement, we noticed that the insurance company had transferred only Rs. 2,00,000 to his account on 29th December 2020, which is far less than the insured amount of Rs. 20,00,000.
Chatbot: Thank you for providing me with all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.
User: I would like to seek the full claim of insurance, Rs.18,00,000 along with interest @ 12% p.a., after deduction of the Rs.2,00,000 deposited in the account. I would like to seek an additional compensation of Rs. 3,00,000.
Chatbot: You could also seek for the costs of the litigation, i.e expenses incurred.
User: In that case, I would like to seek Rs.35,000 as costs.
Chatbot: Based on the above information provided you could file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, or you could also contact the respective State Consumer Helpline Number where you can talk to an agent and address your grievance.
