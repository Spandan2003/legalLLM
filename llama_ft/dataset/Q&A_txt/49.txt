(This hypothetical chatbot Q&A is based on CC/46/2022 from Before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, North Goa at Porvorim)

Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you?
User: My TV faced some technical difficulties within the warranty period, but the TV service centre is demanding additional costs to repair the TV
Chatbot: That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
User: Yes, in August 2017 I had purchased a Lloyd LED TV manufactured by Havells India Ltd for Rs. 54,000 from their authorized dealer M/s Siddhi Towers, Bicholim.
Chatbot: Do you have the original purchase invoice?
User: Yes I have the purchase invoice and warranty card with me. The TV started having issues within the warranty period of 5 years.
Chatbot: Okay. What kind of issues did you face and when did they start?
User: The display started flickering and audio stopped working intermittently from February 2021.
Chatbot: Did you contact the dealer for repairs?
User: Yes, despite my repeated complaints, their service center failed to repair it properly. Instead they asked me to pay Rs. 43,000 to replace the TV itself!
Chatbot: But it was still under warranty period, so this response is unjustified. What happened then?
User: I agreed for a replacement in good faith, but faced further harassment when their representatives offered defective pieces twice, which again developed issues.
Chatbot: Okay, thank you for the information. You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to M/s Siddhi Towers. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000. The Consumer Helpline will give assistance regarding how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?
User: I prefer sending legal notice. 
Chatbot: Certainly. I will need some more information from you related to the matter. Can you please tell me the following: your full name with address, age, and occupation, and the registered address of the company. 
User: Sure. My details are 1. Mr. Jayesh Kanolkar residing at Aged 38 years, S/o Shankar Kanolkar, Married, in service, H.No. 257/11, Bela vista Vaddo, Sircaim, Bardez, Goa- 403502, I am a Bank Manager by profession. Opposite party details are: 2. The Managing Director, Havells India Ltd QRG Towers, Sector 126, Noida Uttar Pradesh
Chatbot: Thank you. I would need some more information from you related to the matter to assist you better. What is the relief that you would wish to pursue?
User: I would want a refund of the entire amount of Rs. 54,000/- towards the cost of the TV and compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for mental harassment, as well as litigation charges of Rs. 50,000/-
Chatbot: Thank you for supplying the information! Please find the notice for filing of consumer complaint here. Please note that these are templates that may require certain corrections or modifications and certain details (particularly the date and signature) will need to be filled at your end. 
User: Thank you. I want to file a consumer complaint; can you guide me?
