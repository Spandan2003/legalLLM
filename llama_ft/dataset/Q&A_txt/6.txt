Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User:  I have been facing some issues with VLCC Health Care Limited regarding a cosmetic treatment that I have received. 
Chatbot: Could you please provide me with more details about what happened?
User:  Yes, I'm very unhappy with the treatment I received from VLCC Health Care Limited. I went there for a cosmetic procedure, but they didn't provide me with the treatment that was promised.
Chatbot: I see. Could you walk me through what happened, starting from when you first consulted them?
User:  I visited VLCC Health Care Limited on 11th December 2020 to inquire about a cosmetic treatment. Dr. Rinku Aher examined me and recommended a specific treatment involving Voluma and stem cell therapy. I agreed to proceed with the treatment, and they quoted me a price of Rs. 36,398 for it.
Chatbot: And did you go ahead with the treatment as recommended?
User:  Yes, I did. I deposited an amount of Rs. 9,558 in advance on 12th January 2021, and the treatment was done on 13th January 2021. However, after the treatment, I experienced discomfort, and when I received the bill on 15th January 2021, I noticed that they had used Botox instead of stem cell therapy, which was not what Dr. Aher had recommended.
Chatbot: That sounds concerning. Did you confront them about this discrepancy?
User:  Yes, I spoke to the manager, Dr. Neelima Balla, on 17th January 2021, but she didn't provide any satisfactory explanation. So, I followed up with her via email on 20th January 2021, asking for details about the treatment process and the brand of products they used. Dr. Balla replied on 30th January 2021, claiming that they had used a product called "Micro Gold Botox," which supposedly contained stem cells.
Chatbot: And how did you react to this response?
User:  I was not convinced because I specifically opted for stem cell therapy, not Botox. Feeling deceived, I issued a legal notice to VLCC Health Care Limited on 9th April 2021, demanding compensation for their actions. However, instead of addressing my concerns, they replied with baseless allegations.
Chatbot: Thank you for sharing all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.
User:  I would like a refund of the fees with interest of 24%p.a and and a compensation of Rs.5,00,000.
