Issue No. 3 – Veterinary Insurance 

User: Insurance claim in respect of my deceased cow rejected. What do I do now?  
Chatbot: Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you? 
User: I took an insurance policy on my cow from Pavilion Insurance Private Limited. 
Chatbot: In whose name was the policy taken?
User: The policy was taken in my name
Chatbot:  Are you the beneficiary? 
User: I am the beneficiary as the cows are mine. 
Chatbot: How many cows do you possess? 
User: I have 20 cows
Have you insured all of them? 
User: Yes, I have insured all of them
Chatbot: What is the insured amount?
User: Rs 70,000/- is the insured amount
Chatbot: the premium for the policy? 
User: The premium is Rs 3500/- 
Chatbot: What is the duration of the policy? 
User: From 01/02/2022 to 01/02/2050
Chatbot: Have you paid all the premiums? 
User: Yes, I have. I also have the receipts with me
Chatbot: Given that you purchased a health insurance policy, does your policy have a waiting period in respect of pre-existing illnesses? 
User: Yes, for certain specified diseases, no claim can be made for a period of 6 months from the date of commencement of the policy. 
Chatbot: Okay. What was the cause of your cow’s death?
User: The post-mortem report states that my cow died of ‘Asphyxia associated with Tympanites’.
Chatbot:  Is it covered under the pre-existing diseases/illnesses clause? 
User: I am not sure if it is covered under the pre-existing illnesses clause. 
Chatbot: That’s okay. When it comes to insurance policies, it is important to read the terms and conditions of the policy carefully as many a time in respect of health insurance, claims arising out of pre-existing illnesses will be disallowed for a certain period of time initially. 
User: Okay 
Chatbot: When was your cow diagnosed with this problem? 
User: I didn’t know of its existence. Each one of my cows gave 10L of milk every day. If anything, it only reinforces the sound health of my cows. 
Chatbot: Did the insurance company conduct a medical examination before issuing the policy? 
User: Yes, according to the medical certificate issued, my cow didn’t have any disease at the time of taking the policy.  
Chatbot: Okay, firstly, you may want to find out from a medical expert as to whether the cause of death can be attributed to a medical disease or not. If yes, please read the pre-existing illnesses clause of your policy once. 
User: It’s not a disease, and the waiting period condition does not apply to my policy. 
Chatbot: Okay, in that case, why did the insurance company reject your claim? 
User: They stated that there was a clause in my policy according to which death due to pre-existing diseases/illnesses occurring within six months from the commencement of the policy would not be covered. Since my cow died within a month from the start date of the policy, they repudiated my claim? 
Chatbot: Could you please tell me the date of death of your cow? 
User: 15/02/2022
Chatbot: Okay. Does the insurance company have an appeal mechanism for rejected claims? 
User: Yes, they do. I registered a complaint on the website, but there was no response from their side. 
Chatbot: When did you register a complaint? 
User: 20/02/2022
User: I also sent reminder emails on 21/02/2022 and 25/02/2022. 
Chatbot: Did you receive a reply? 
User: I received a reply from the customer care division on 27/02/2022, but it wasn't any different from the one given earlier. 
Chatbot: Did you consider sending them a legal notice? 
User: I sent a notice dated 10/03/2022 seeking satisfaction of my claim, but the reply given to me stated the same reason as mentioned before. 
Chatbot: Okay. You can take up your case with the Insurance Ombudsman, if you would like to.
Chatbot: Here’s the link https://www.cioins.co.in/ 
User: I would like to file a complaint before the consumer forum
Chatbot: I understand. In that case, if you think you have disclosed all the material facts, and that there is no ground for rejection based on the terms and conditions of the policy, you can file a complaint with the consumer dispute redressal commission. 
User: What is the procedure? 
Chatbot: You can either file a complaint online using the E Daakhil portal, or submit a physical copy in the district consumer dispute redressal commission. The competent court would be the one that is situated in your city of residence, or where the cow died.
