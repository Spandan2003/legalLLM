Chatbot:Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you. 

User: Hello, I  faced a problem with my train ticket booking. 

Chatbot: Could you please provide me some basic details about your grievance so that I have the full context?

User: Sure. I had booked two train tickets from Madurai to Chennai for a journey on 20.08.2019. The tickets were booked on 12.08.2019 for me and another elderly, disabled person who was to travel with me. However, when we went to board the train on the day of the journey, we were denied boarding by
 the ticket inspector saying my name was wrongly printed on the ticket.

Chatbot: I understand. Could you please provide me your full name, age, address and contact details for the records? This would be required when filing the consumer complaint.

User: My name is R. Jawahar, I am 70 years old and work at my shop for a living.  My address is - Mela Chinnampatti, Kalvelippatti Post, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District, PIN 625514. My mobile number is 9999xxxxxx.

Chatbot: Thank you for providing your details, Mr Jawahar. Could you also please confirm the complete details of your co-passenger - his name, age, disability details, address and contact number?

User: Sure. His name is G. Kannan, age 61 years, Occupation: Retired Employee(Revenue Department). He is physically handicapped and needs my support to travel. His address is - D.No. 2/691, Bharathi Nagar, Kannanendal, Madurai - 625014. His mobile number is 8888yyyyyy. 

Chatbot: Noted. So if I understand correctly, you and Mr Kannan had booked confirmed train tickets from Madurai to Chennai for the 20.08.2019 journey. But you both were denied boarding due to incorrect names printed for you on the tickets. Right?

User: Yes, that is right. When we reached the station and tried to board, the ticket inspector informed me that my name was printed incorrectly as 'Sri Murugan' instead of 'R. Jawahar' on the reservation chart. My age was also wrongly mentioned as 45 years instead of 70 years. Due to this mistake in the chart, we were denied boarding on the train.

Chatbot: Okay. Could you please confirm:

1. Date when you had booked the tickets: 
2. How did you book the tickets - online or at the station counter?
3. The train PNR number:
4. Exact mistake in the name/age printed on reservation chart:

This will help me capture the full details.

User: Sure, here are the details:

1. We booked the tickets on 12.08.2019
2. The booking was done at Madurai Railway station reservation counter by submitting manual requisition form
3. The PNR number was 8765091230 
4. My name was printed as 'Sri Murugan' instead of 'R. Jawahar' and age was shown as 45 years instead of 70 years

I have the ticket copies and reservation form copy for proof.

Chatbot: Thank you Mr Jawahar. This provides me with the complete context of what transpired. Just a few more questions, what did you do after being denied boarding - did you still travel or cancel your journey? 

User: We were forced to cancel our train journey and had to urgently book bus tickets to travel on that day to Chennai. This caused grave inconvenience as the bus journey was much more uncomfortable for us.

Chatbot: Did you face any financial losses or other difficulties due to this issue?

User: We suffered financial loss as we had to purchase costlier bus tickets on urgent booking. We also had to cancel our confirmed return train bookings from Chennai to Madurai scheduled for 21.08.2019, as we did not travel by train on the onward journey.

Chatbot: As you have used an alternate mode to transport can you please tell the approximate financial loss suffered by you and Mr Kannan due to - 
   a) Purchasing alternative bus tickets
   b) Cancellation of return train tickets

User: Financial loss details:
   a) We spent approx Rs 3000 per person on urgent booking of bus tickets
   b) The cancelled return train tickets were of approx Rs 400 per person
Chatbot: Did you submit any written complaint to Railway authorities and receive any response?

User: Yes I submitted a written complaint to railway authorities (on 03.12.2019) regarding deficiency in service and mental agony caused to us. But I did not receive any response or resolution to the complaint.


Chatbot: So this is a clear case of deficiency of service. You can send a legal notice and also file a complaint against the other party. What do you want me to draft for you?

User: Kindly draft the legal notice and the complaint for me. 

Chatbot: For the purpose of drafting notice and complaint, could you please confirm your residential address again so I have it on record for jurisdiction purposes.

User: My residential address is  Mela Chinnampatti, Kalvelippatti Post, Vadipatti Taluk, Madurai District, PIN 625514. 

Chatbot:  Do you have any documents evidencing the train reservation, complaint to railway etc that can be enclosed with the consumer complaint?Please upload them.

User: Yes I have the following documents and uploaded them.
   - Original train reservation ticket 
   - Cancelled return reservation tickets
   - Copy of manual reservation form submitted to book tickets
   - Copy of written complaint dated 03.12.2019 submitted to Railways
