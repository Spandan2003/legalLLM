Issue No. 15 – Deficiency in service (statement of account) 

User: The bank with which I have a loan account has not provided me with a proper statement of accounts. Do I have a remedy under the Consumer Protection Act? 
Chatbot: Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
User: The bank with which I have a loan account has not provided me with a proper statement of accounts. How do I proceed further? 
Chatbot: Could you please specify the details of your loan account? 
User: 
     Bank Name: Cenza Bank Private Limited 
     Branch: Jeevan Nagar, Cosmos 
     IFSC Code: xxxx 
     Loan Account no. – 43256943217
     Amount borrowed: Rs 10,00,000/- 
 Chatbot: When was the loan granted? 
  User: 10/02/2012
Chatbot: What was the EMI amount that you were required to pay? 
   User: Rs 15,000/-  
Chatbot: Duration of EMI payment? 
   User: 84 months
Chatbot: Thanks, could you please briefly explain your grievance? 
User: On 10/06/2012, 10/08/2012 and 10/03/2013, I made lump sum payments of Rs 1,00,000 each towards repayment of my loan. 
User: Thereafter, on 25/03/2013, I sent an email to the bank stating that I would like to opt for pre-closure of my loan account, and in furtherance of the same, I requested a statement of accounts in respect of my loan account from the bank. However, instead of a loan account statement, I received a letter dated 29/03/2013 stating that I have an outstanding balance in my account of Rs 5,00,000, however, the amount did not give proper credit to the advance payments made and also the interest rebates. 
Chatbot: What was your response? 
User: I visited the bank in person on 01/04/2013 to convey my decision regarding pre-closure of my loan account and also for clarification regarding the outstanding balance and also discrepancies in the statement of my loan account. 
The institution’s reply was evasive. They did not offer any proper explanation for the concerns raised by me. They said they would look into the matter and get back. 
Chatbot: Have you heard from them after that?
User: No, I contacted the 24x 7 customer care division of the bank on 05/04/2013 to register my grievances, and sent e-mails to the bank for clarification. 
User: Finally, on 10/05/2013, I received a statement of my loan account but again the statement did not reflect the advance payments made by me, and also did not adjust for the interest rebates that I was eligible for. 
Chatbot: I understand. What is the relief that you are looking for right now?
User: I want the bank to provide me with a proper statement of accounts in respect of my loan account after giving due credit to the payments made by me, and also compensation for the delay in furnishing the statement of accounts, not providing timely assistance with respect to the pre-closure of my loan account. 
User: I have a doubt. The loan document states that parties should resort to only arbitration in case of any disputes. Will I be able to claim relief under the consumer protection act? 
Chatbot: Thanks for the question. You can take recourse to consumer protection act as well for compensation in addition to other modes of dispute resolution. Hope that answers your query. 
User: Thanks
Chatbot: Have you considered sending them a notice? 
User: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 15/05/2023, but I have not received any reply from them

User: Yes, I would like to approach the consumer dispute redressal commission. Could you please let me know the procedure? 
Chatbot: Sure, could you please tell me where your residence is?
