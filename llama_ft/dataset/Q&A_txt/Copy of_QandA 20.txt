(This hypothetical chatbot Q&A is based on CC/09/2021 from Before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, North Goa at Porvorim)

Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you?
User: The insurance company has rejected my insurance claim.
Chatbot: That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
User: I am the owner of a TATA vehicle bearing Registration No. GA-05-T-5760 which I purchased on 28/11/2020 and got registered on 02/12/2020. The vehicle is hypothecated with IndusInd Bank Ltd., Panaji Goa Branch. I insured the vehicle on 30/11/2020 with policy no. 3379/0282569/000/00 valid until 29/11/2021 Insurance Company. On 31/10/2021 at around 11.45 hrs, while the vehicle was traveling from Bhiwandi to Goa, it caught fire at Kamtheghat Chiplun, Maharashtra. The fire originated from jamming of the liner at the backside of the vehicle which led the tyre to catch fire and spread through the vehicle. There was no negligent driving by the driver Mr. Jarrar Khan who had a valid driving license no. UP4720020000221 at that time. I duly intimated the incident on 31/10/2021 through the Insurance Company's toll-free number and the claim was registered as Claim No. 3379350022 for Rs.5,00,000/-. However, I received an email from Insurance Company representative Mr. Eknath More on 20/01/2022 denying the claim processing.
Chatbot: You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Co. Ltd..

The Consumer Helpline will give assistance regarding how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?
User: I prefer sending legal notice.  
Chatbot: Certainly. I will need some more information from you related to the matter. Can you please tell me the following: your full name with address, age, and occupation, and the registered address of the Insurance Company?
User: Sure. 1. Firsat Ali Khan, residing at B-7, KGN House, Kayji Residency, Near Curti Panchayat Office, Curti, Ponda Goa,  and my occupation is as a retailer of fresh vegetables and fruit. 2. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Co. Ltd.  203, Dempo Trade Centre, Patto, Panjim, Goa- 403001. 
Chatbot: Thank you. I would need some more information from you related to the matter to assist you better. What is the relief that you would wish to pursue?
User: I would want a refund of the entire amount and compensation for mental harassment.
Chatbot: Thank you for supplying the information! Please find the notice for filing of consumer complaint here. Please note that these are templates that may require certain corrections or modifications and certain details (particularly the date and signature) will need to be filled at your end. 
User: Thank you. I want to file a consumer complaint; can you guide me?
