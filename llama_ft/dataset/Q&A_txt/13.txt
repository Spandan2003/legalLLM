Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User: I want to file a complaint against the hospital for their poor services. Guide me
Chatbot: Certainly. Could you please elaborate what is the issue that you faced with hospital services.
User: On May 6, 2019, I was involved in a serious auto accident where a lorry collided with the auto I was traveling in. As a result, I sustained multiple injuries, including a post-operative fracture to my left femur. I was immediately transported to Usha Prime Multi Speciality Hospital for treatment.
Chatbot: And what treatment did you receive at the hospital?
User:  I underwent several medical procedures and treatments at the hospital, incurring medical expenses totaling Rs. 79,000. However, I believe there were deficiencies in the services provided by the hospital and the attending consultant, Dr. K. Raja Sagar.
Chatbot: Can you elaborate on these deficiencies in service?
User:  Yes, despite the severity of my injuries, the hospital issued a wound certificate indicating that my injuries were "simple in nature" rather than "grievous." This discrepancy in the documentation could have significant implications for any legal proceedings related to the accident.
Chatbot: I see. And did you attempt to address these issues with the hospital and Dr. Raja Sagar directly?
User:  Yes, I issued a legal notice to both the hospital and Dr. Raja Sagar on July 23, 2019, outlining my concerns and requesting appropriate action. Unfortunately, they responded with a notice of their own on July 30, 2019, without addressing the issues raised in my notice.
Chatbot: Do you have the copies of the legal notices and any other relevant documentation related to your treatment at the hospital?
User:  Yes, I have copies of all the correspondence, including the legal notices and medical records. 
Chatbot: Thank you for providing me with all this information. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are looking for.
User: I would like to seek a compensation of Rs.18,00,000 with an interest @ 9 % p.a. And Rs.30,000 for the mental agony and Rs.10,000 for the costs.
