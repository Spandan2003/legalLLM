Chatbot: Hello, a Chatbot assistant created to help consumers resolve their grievances. How may I assist you today?
Sura: Hi. I want to file a complaint against a two-wheeler dealership regarding an issue I faced during purchase of a new vehicle.
Chatbot: Okay. I can help you with filing a consumer complaint. But first, let me understand the full details of your case. Could you please provide me some basic information like your name, age, address etc?
Sura: Sure. My name is Sura Dasharatha and I am 35 years old. I reside at House Number 3-138, Peddamandadi Village, Peddamandadi Mandal, Wanaparthy District, Telangana - 509103.
Chatbot: Thank you for providing the details. Now, please explain what the complaint is about and what happened exactly?
Sura: So I purchased a new two-wheeler - a Honda CD 110 from a dealership named Narmada Honda located at Polytechnic Road, Wanaparthy. The authorized dealer's name is Bondili Venugopal Singh. On 15th November 2020, I paid Rs. 30,000 as downpayment and opted for financing the remaining amount from a bank.
Chatbot: Okay. Please provide me the full address of the dealership and the name of the authorized dealer against whom you want to file the complaint.
Sura: The dealership address is - Narmada Honda, #44-24/19, 20, 21, Raja Rameshwar Rao Complex, Polytechnic Road, Wanaparthy, Telangana - 509103. And the authorized dealer is Mr. Bondili Venugopal Singh, son of Bondili Madan Mohan Singh.
Chatbot: Noted. You can proceed to explain the issue you faced.
Sura: At the time of purchasing the two-wheeler, the dealer offered a Diwali gift hamper of a LED TV worth Rs. 13,999. This offer was part of their festive promotion and was advertised through pamphlets. On the day of delivery of my vehicle, they provided a LED TV worth only Rs. 6,000 instead of the promised Rs. 13,999 LED TV.
Chatbot: Okay. So they had advertised an offer but did not fulfill it properly during delivery. Did you speak to them about this at that time?
Sura: Yes, when they gave me the Rs. 6,000 LED TV, I immediately informed that this is not as per the promised offer. I requested them to provide the LED TV worth Rs. 13,999 as advertised. But they refused. I made many requests later on also, but they did not agree to give the correct LED TV per the offer.
Chatbot: Hmm...I understand this must have been very disappointing and caused you inconvenience. What was their response when you requested them to honor the original offer?
Sura: They simply denied my request and said they can't provide the higher value LED TV. No proper explanation was given in spite of my multiple requests through phone calls and personal visits.
Chatbot: Did you make the requests to them in writing via email or letter?
Sura: No, I did not write to them formally but I have proof of the offer they made in the pamphlet and the lower value LED TV bill which clearly shows their deficiency in service.
Chatbot: Okay thanks for explaining it clearly. Just a couple more questions - when exactly did you purchase the two-wheeler and when did you get delivery? Also, do you have the purchase invoice and any other documents related to this transaction?
Sura: I purchased the two-wheeler on 15th November 2020 and took delivery also on the same date. Yes I have the original purchase invoice, the booking form copy and a copy of the promotional Diwali offer pamphlet given by the dealership. I can provide you copies of these documents.
Chatbot: That would be very helpful. Please provide me scanned copies of the invoice, booking form/receipt, promotional pamphlet and any other proofs related to this purchase. These documents will support your complaint.
Sura: Sure, I will send you soft copies of all the documents by email. I also have the original hard copies if required later.
Chatbot: Wonderful. This is very good documentation to prove your case. Just a couple more questions - have you filed any formal complaints against the dealership before approaching me? If yes, please provide details.
Sura: No I have not filed any formal complaint against them anywhere yet. You are the first one I am approaching for help to resolve this issue.
Chatbot: Okay thanks for clarifying. Last question - how much compensation or relief amount are you seeking from the dealership through your complaint?
Sura: I want them to provide the LED TV worth Rs. 13,999 as per their promotional offer. I do not have any specific compensation amount in mind, but I believe I should be reimbursed for the mental agony and harassment caused by their unfair trade practice. I also want to be compensated for the costs involved in filing this complaint.
Chatbot: Duly noted. Thank you Mr. Sura for providing all the details clearly. I now have a good understanding of your grievance and the issue. I will draft a consumer complaint on your behalf highlighting all these points and also suggesting appropriate compensation and relief amounts. I will send it to you for review before we proceed to file it with the consumer court. Do let me know if you need any other assistance.

Please fill in the details that have been left blank, such as the date and your signature. In addition to the complaint, you must also submit an affidavit and a document called the “Memorandum of Parties”. Do you want me to provide you with the pre-filled versions of the same?
