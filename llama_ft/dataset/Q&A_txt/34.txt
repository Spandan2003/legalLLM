Issue No. 4 – Deficiency in Service (EMI payments)  

User: The bank has increased my EMI and modified the tenure of my loan without prior notice? Do I have a remedy? 
Chatbot: Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
User: I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of Cenza Bank Private Limited located in the city of Cosmos on 04/02/2022 at 10:30 am for information regarding auto loans. On 06/02/2022, the bank sanctioned a loan amount of Rs 10,00,000/- for the purchase of a car. 
Chatbot: Is there anything else that you would like to add?
User: Details regarding the EMI were sent via SMS, and as per the message sent, I was supposed to pay Rs 25,000 per month for the time period of  50 months beginning March 2022. However, at the time of the first EMI payment, I received an email which stated that I would have to pay Rs 30,000 per month for the period of 40 months beginning March 2022. 
Chatbot: When was the loan agreement entered into? 
User: On 08/06/2022, and the hire-purchase agreement was also signed on 10/06/2022 
Chatbot: What kind of interest rate did you opt for? 
User: Fixed 
Chatbot: What does the loan agreement state in terms of the EMI to be paid? Does it have clauses that subject it to periodic revision? 
User: As per the loan agreement, it was Rs 5,000 per month  for the time period of 24 months. The only caveat was that it could be modified under special circumstances. 
Chatbot: Were you informed of any special circumstances that merited changes in the interest rate? 
User: No 
User: Also, the financier promised to make the necessary changes in RC book and insurance policy but hasn’t done it yet. 
Chatbot: Okay. With respect to the EMI payments, it is to be noted that between the SMS received and the loan agreement, the latter would have an overriding effect, so if the EMI notification received in March 2022 is not as per the loan agreement, you may be able to raise a valid grievance. 
Chatbot: With respect to the name changes in the RC book and insurance policy for a vehicle purchased under a hire-purchase agreement, it might help to take note of the fact that applications for name changes have to be initiated not by the financier alone, but along with the owner of the vehicle or any authorized agent. 
Please refer to Chapter III of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. 
Chatbot: Have you authorized the financier to file an application on your behalf? 
User: No
Chatbot: Then, I am afraid you may not be able to claim relief for the delay in name transfer. 
User: Also, I work as a driver so I purchased the vehicle for not just personal use. Will I still be able to claim relief under the consumer protection act?  
Chatbot: Thanks for the question. You will be able to approach the consumer protection forum as you purchased the vehicle in furtherance of your livelihood. 
Please refer to section 2(7) of the 2019 Consumer Protection Act for more information. 
Hope that answers your query. 
User: Okay. How do I proceed to obtain compensation in respect of the EMI issue? 
Chatbot: If the bank has not been responsive to your requests, you can approach the banking ombudsman.

Chatbot: Alternatively, you can approach the consumer dispute redressal forum for deficiency in service 
User: I would like to approach the consumer protection forum 
Chatbot: Okay, before that, have you considered sending them a notice? 
User: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 15/04/2022, but I have not received any reply from them yet
Chatbot: Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum? 
User: Yes, I would like to 
Chatbot: Okay, could you please tell me where your residence is?
