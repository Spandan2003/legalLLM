(This hypothetical chatbot Q&A is based on CC/84/2018 from Before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, North goa at Porvorim)

Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User: I was cheated by a real estate agency 
Chatbot: That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the issues that you are facing?
User: Yes, thank you. In 2005, the local agents Mr. and Mrs. Nanoskar convinced me that Parees Enterprises was very profitable. Trusting them, I ended up investing a total Rs. 2,88,225 over the next few years.
Chatbot: Do you remember the dates and amounts you invested?
User: Let me recall...I invested on 10/02/10 an amount of Rs. 96,075/-, then on 10/02/15 an amount of Rs. 96,075/-  and finally on 10/02/20 an amount: Rs. 96,075/- 
Chatbot: Okay. Did they provide you with any receipts for these investments?
User: Yes, they provided some handwritten receipts on Parees letterhead for the amounts I paid. I can share copies.
Chatbot: That will be helpful. So what was the maturity date they promised?
User: They said the investment will mature in 2020 and I can redeem my money after that. But when I approached them in early 2020, they started avoiding me.
Chatbot: Did you issue any written communication to them for the redemption?
User: I sent them multiple emails in 2020 but they simply ignored all communication. It has been over 2 years now but I have not received a single rupee back.
Chatbot: Okay, thank you for the information. You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to Parees Enterprises. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000. The Consumer Helpline will give assistance regarding how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?
User: I prefer sending a legal notice. 
Chatbot: Certainly. I will need some more information from you related to the matter. Can you please tell me the following: your full name with address, age, and occupation, and the registered office address of the Telephone company as well as the details of your landline phone?
