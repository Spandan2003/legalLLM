(This hypothetical chatbot Q&A is based on CC/43/2022 from Before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, North Goa at Porvorim)

Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you?
User: I was cheated by an online platform. 
Chatbot: That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
Client: Thank you. I had ordered a Sony Walkman on www.vlebazaar.in website on 09/03/2022 and paid Rs. 12,745 via my ICICI debit card. The order ID was 1461182.
Lawyer: Do you have the order details and payment receipt?
Client: Yes, I have all the records ready. They promised 7 day delivery but I never received it.
Lawyer: Okay, what happened then?
Client: On inquiring, I found out I had paid to a fraudulent account. So I cancelled the order on 29/04/2022 and requested a refund.
Lawyer: And did they agree for the refund?
Client: They said refund will be done by 13/07/2022 but I needed it urgently. So on 21/07/2022, I complained to ICICI Bank.
Lawyer: Alright. What was the response from the bank?
Client: The bank manager refunded Rs. 12,745 on 16/07/2022 calling it a "ghost credit" as it didn't reflect in my balance.
Lawyer: Ghost credit? This sounds suspicious.
Client: Yes, but the shocking part is, after getting this refund, the amount was re-transferred back to Vlebazaar's account without any authorization or OTP from me!
Lawyer: What! The money was taken back without your consent? This is absolutely illegal.
Client: Yes! I lost my hard earned money due to this scam. Please help me get it back.
 
Chatbot: Dont worry, I am here to help you. You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to VLE Bazzar. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000. The Consumer Helpline will assist how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?
User: I prefer sending legal notice. 
Chatbot: Certainly. I will need some more information from you related to the matter. Can you please tell me the following: your full name with address, age, and occupation, and the registered address of Sony Centre in India and Goa? Further please provide details of the Television, what was the price you purchased for, the dates on which the technicians visited your house and the date of delivery. 
User: Sure. My details are 1. Winston Souza Xavier, S/o S. Xavier, R/o 37/1C, Xell Bastora, Bardez, Goa. Opposite Party details are: 2. Mr. Himanshu Agarwal and Aman Agarwal, VLE Bazzar, Store address plot no. 4, Numberbad Marker, Grace Road, Sec 22, Gurgaon 1220022 Sec 28. 
Chatbot: Thank you. I would need some more information from you related to the matter to assist you better. What is the relief that you would wish to pursue?
User: I would want a replacement of the Power tilling machine, a refund of the entire amount of Rs. 1,13,500/- and compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for mental harassment.
Chatbot: Thank you for supplying the information! Please find the notice for filing of consumer complaint here. Please note that these are templates that may require certain corrections or modifications and certain details (particularly the date and signature) will need to be filled at your end. 
User: Thank you. I want to file a consumer complaint; can you guide me?
Chatbot: Thank you! Before I give further details regarding the compliant draft, do you want to claim litigation expenses as well? 
User: Yes, I want Litigation charges of Rs. 50,000/-. 
Chatbot: Sure. Since the value of the Walkman product is Rs. 12,745/- which is less than Fifty Lakh Rupees, the complaint will have to be filed in a District Commission. You, as a complainant, reside in Bardez district and the cause of action arises in Bardez. The opposite party carries on business in Gurgaon.
