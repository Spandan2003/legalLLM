Chatbot:Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you. 

Consumer: Hi . I need help with filing a consumer complaint against a chit fund operator who has not paid me my due amount. 

Chatbot: Okay, Could you please start by telling me your name and some basic details about yourself?

Consumer: Sure. My name is A. Balavardhan Reddy, son of A. Ram Reddy. I am 35 years old and work as a private employee. I reside at House Number 1-21, Yellareddypalle village, Koilkonda mandal, Mahabubnagar district.

Chatbot: Thank you for providing those details Mr. Balavardhan Reddy. Now, can you please explain to me in detail  about the chit fund issue you are facing? 

Consumer: The chit fund operator is an individual named S. Govardhan Reddy, son of Narayan Reddy. He is around 53 years old and runs this business in Mahabubnagar district. He currently resides in Hyderabad after shifting from his native place. Actually, Govardhan Reddy and I are distant relatives. When he started this chit fund scheme in Mahabubnagar in 2015, he approached me and requested that I join as a chit member since he knew me. It is an unregistered chit fund operation.

Chatbot: What was the total chit value you opted for and what were the terms regarding duration, instalments, commission etc?

Consumer: I joined the chit fund in October 2015 when it commenced. The total chit value I opted for was Rs 5,00,000. It was scheduled to run for 25 months, so my monthly subscription amount was Rs 20,000. As per the terms, 5% commission would be deducted from the chit amount. 

Chatbot: Were any written documents or agreements executed between you and Mr. Govardhan Reddy regarding this chit fund? 

Consumer: No, nothing in writing was made. Everything was on trust and verbal agreement since we knew each other. But he did issue receipts in my name for all the monthly payments I made. 

Chatbot: Okay, the receipts will help prove your case. For how long did you continue paying the monthly subscriptions? When did you stop?

Consumer: I paid the Rs 20,000 every month diligently for the entire duration of 25 months till October 2017 when the chit fund cycle was supposed to end. I was the last member in this chit.

Chatbot: What happened after you completed all the 25 month payments? Did you receive your chit amount from Mr. Govardhan Reddy? 

Consumer: No, that is the issue. After I paid the entire amount, I approached him multiple times asking to pay me my chit amount of Rs 4,75,000 (after deducting his 5% commission). But he kept delaying and postponing on some pretext or the other.

Chatbot: I understand. Can you please elaborate what excuses he gave for not paying your amount and how many months this went on?
Consumer: He first said he has to manage finances for his daughter's wedding. Then over the next 2 years, he gave some reason or the other - financial constraints, bank delays, etc. In total, he did not pay me for almost 3 years after the chit fund ended. I approached him many times from November 2017 to August 2020 for my chit amount.

Chatbot: That is a very long delay. What finally transpired in August 2020 after 3 years of chasing him? Were you able to recover your hard earned money?

Consumer: In August 2020, I pressured him a lot and he finally agreed to execute a promissory note. He gave this written promise that he will pay the chit amount of Rs 4,75,000 along with interest at 24% per annum from November 2017 till August 2020. The total amount he promised in the promissory note was Rs 7,50,000.

Chatbot: Okay, so you have this promissory note from August 2020. Further what happened.

Consumer: As per the note, he said he will pay me in 3 months, but 3 months passed and he kept dodging. This continued for another few months despite my regular follow-ups. Finally in December 2020 he stopped responding to me. I lost hope of recovering my money. I have now decided to take legal recourse by filing a formal complaint against him with your assistance.

Chatbot: I will certainly help you file an effective consumer complaint. Before that, do you have the promissory note given by Mr. Govardhan Reddy in August 2020? And the receipts of your 25 monthly payments? This will be important evidence.

Consumer: Yes I have both. I have kept them safely ready. 

Chatbot: Wonderful, that documentation will make your case very strong. Can you confirm that this entire chit fund business of Mr. Govardhan Reddy is unregistered and informal? There are no company documents?

Consumer: Yes, absolutely. It is an unregistered, informal business. There are no company registration papers or anything like that. Just my receipts and his note. 

Chatbot: Have you sent any legal notice to the opposite party? If not, I would  recommend you send one legal notice to the opposite party. 

Consumer: I have not sent any legal notice to the opposite party. Kindly, draft a legal notice and the consumer complaint. 

Chatbot: Here is the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

Consumer:User: Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy. Then I will need to file a consumer complaint. 

Chatbot: Yes, then you may file a consumer complaint. Do you want me to draft a complaint?

Consumer: Yes, Kindly draft a consumer complaint.

Chatbot: Sure, I would draft the complaint. But for this I need some additional information, like name of the parties, your name and the name of the opposite party, age, occupation, address based on that I would also recommend a jurisdiction in which the complaint can be filed.

Consumer: Use of address as, A. Balavardhan Reddy  S/o A. Ram Reddy,  Aged 35 years,  
Occ: Private Employee R/o H.No.1-21, Yellareddypalle Village,  Koilkonda Mandal, Mahabubnagar District and the other party’s address as S.

Srinagar Colony, Ramanthapur, Hyderabad.

Chatbot: Based on the information provided you can file a consumer complaint at the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar and Hyderabad. 

Consumer: I would  like to file a complaint in Mahabubnagar.

Chatbot:  Could you please tell what relief you expect from the court, for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party. 

Consumer: In terms of remedy I would like to have a compensation amount of Rs.4,75,000/- covered under the chit fund along with the interest and Rs.2,00,000/- towards compensation for mental agony and Rs. 50,000 as cost of the complaint.
