Chatbot:Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you. 
User: Hi Chatbot, I purchased a water purifier online last year which has been giving me trouble since day 1. 

Chatbot: I understand, let's take this step-by-step so I can gather all the details. Could you start by providing your name, age, occupation and location details?

User: Sure, my name is Gouni Consumer Reddy, I'm 20 years old and currently a student. I reside at House no. 16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur Mandal in Wanaparthy District.

Chatbot: Thank you for the introduction Mr. Gouni Consumer Reddy. Can you now explain the purchasing details as to the water purifier you had purchased?
User: I purchased an Aquasure Delight RO+UV+MTDS water purifier made by Eureka Forbes Limited. I bought it online through Amazon India on 6th August 2020 for the amount of Rs. 8,990/-. There was a delay in installation due to Covid restrictions at that time. The installation happened only on 25th August 2020, almost 20 days after delivery. But as soon as it was installed I noticed there was some leakage happening from the purifier. I complained about this defect on the same day, 25th August 2020.

Chatbot: What response did you get from the company when you first complained about this leakage?

User: I called their customer care multiple times but there was no proper response. After continuously following up for 10 days, a service technician finally came after a month and was able to fix the leakage temporarily. The issues continued. While the leakage was fixed, now the purifier started taking too much time to purify water and also started wasting a lot of water during the process. I again started calling the Eureka Forbes customer care regularly to complain. They would assure me everytime that they were sending a technician within 24 hours, but no one would turn up for weeks.After waiting for a month, the technician came and said I need to install an additional filter in the purifier, which would cost me Rs. 380 extra. I had no choice but to agree and get it installed.

Chatbot:. Did installing this extra filter solve all the water purifier problems?

User: No, even after installing the additional filter, I continued to face problems frequently. I had to call them multiple times again for the same issues. Then another technician came after a month and said the RO membrane had to be replaced. There was some improvement after the membrane was changed. But after about 1 week, the purifier stopped working again. Each time it would work only for a few days and then break down again.

Chatbot: Very frustrating experience you have had. After all these issues, what did the company technicians finally say? 

User: Technician was of the opinion that it is better to go for replacement of the product. Based on this I asked for the refund or replacement but the company said that the water purifier can not be replaced or returned only within 30 days of purchase as per the company’s terms and conditions. After this I registered a grievance on the consumer helpline website on 15-04-2021, vide No.2679203, after 3 months, I got a mail stating that “intimated customer as per policy can not refund or replace the unit after purchase of 10 months”.

Chatbot: See the machine was not working since day one and there have been multiple attempts to approach the opposite party. I would also recommend you send the legal notice to the opposite party.

User: Yes, please draft the notice and ask for the replacement of the water purifier. 

Chatbot: I would draft the complaint and the notice. But for this I need some additional information, like the name of the parties, your name and the name and address of the opposite party. Kindly noted that we will have 2 opposite parties, Eureka Forbes Ltd and Amazon India. 

User: You can mention my address as Gouni Sai Charan Reddy, S/o Gouni Harshavardhan Reddy, aged 20 years, Occ: Student, R/o H.No.16-61, Sai Ram Veterinary Medical Stores, Opposite Bus Stand In-gate, Srinivasa Colony, Atmakur mandal, Wanaparthy District.

The Authorised Signatory, Amazon India, Brigade Gateway, 8th Floor, 26/1, Dr. Rajkumar Road, Malleshwaram (W), Bangalore - 560055, Karnataka.

Chatbot:  Could you please tell what relief you expect, for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party.
