Issue No. 5 – Inferior quality of sofa set
User: I received a defective sofa set. What do I do now? 
Chatbot: Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you? 
User: I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of ABC Furniture Private Limited located in the city of Cosmos on 04/02/2022 at 6:30 pm, and purchased a three-seater sofa. 
Chatbot: Okay. Could you please describe the sofa that you purchased? 
User: It’s a black three-seater sofa, and the model number is AX672341.
Chatbot: What was the cost of the product? 
User: Rs 1,50,000/-
Chatbot: What was the problem with the sofa? 
User: The problem was with the upholstery of the sofa which started peeling off on its own within a few days from the date of purchase.  
Chatbot: What is the warranty period of the product? 
User: 1 year 
Chatbot: Did you ask the company to fix the sofa, or replace the product? 
User: Yes, I did, but to no avail. I called them on 10/02/2022 to voice my concerns. They said they would replace the sofa without mentioning the time period for the same, but they didn’t deliver on their promise. 
Chatbot: Does the company have an option to raise complaints on its website? 
User: Yes, they do. I did that as well on 13/02/2022, but didn’t receive any acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint. On 14/02/2022, I visited the showroom in person, and on 15/02/2022, I contacted them using their toll free number, but all efforts went in vain.
Chatbot: Is there anything else that you would like to add? 
User: When I brought up the matter of warranty period for the product, I was informed that issues that arise due to the negligent conduct of the customer would not be covered;hence, the furniture was neither replaced, nor was the issue fixed. 
User: I also asked a number of questions about the product before making the purchase, and the seller gave a positive response to all the questions posed by me. 
Chatbot: Did you consider sending them a legal notice? 
User: Yes, I sent them a legal notice dated 16/02/2022 seeking replacement of the sofa, and an amount of compensation to the tune of Rs 50,000/- for supplying a product of inferior quality.  
Chatbot: What was their response? 
User: I never received any response
Chatbot: Okay, in that case, you can file a complaint on the E-Daakhil platform, or submit the same in person in the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Cosmos
