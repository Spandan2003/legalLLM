Issue No. 14 – Defective product (water purifier) 
User: The water purifier sold to me was defective? What can I do now?  
Chatbot: Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
User: I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of Waves who is one of the authorized dealers of Streamz, the manufacturer of the water purifier, on 03/02/2022 and purchased a water purifier for a sum of Rs 8000/- 
Model Number: AX78945632
Capacity: 5 L
User: The product was installed on 04/02/2022, and an e-receipt for the purchase was sent to my email ID on 03/02/2022. 
User: Within a few days, the purifier stopped working, and on 06/02/2022, I contacted the dealer to inform him about the issue. He said that a technician would be sent within a few days to assess the product. 
Chatbot: Did the technician check the product? 
User: Yes, a technician came on 08/02/2022 to check the product. After a preliminary examination, he concluded that there was an irreparable defect in the product which could not be fixed, instead that the product would have to be replaced 
Chatbot: What was your decision? 
User: I asked him to take the purifier with him and get a new one installed as soon as possible 
Chatbot: Did you get a replacement? 
User: Not yet.
Chatbot: Did you find out from the dealer about it? 
User: I sent an email on 20/02/2022 to find out about the status of the request for replacement. The dealer simply stated that the matter was still under consideration and that the request would be processed within a few days.
Chatbot: Any update after that? 
User: No 
User: on 21/02/2022, I registered my grievance in the customer feedback section hoping that the opposite party would reply at least to the grievance raised on the website. At this point, I also requested the seller to refund the money paid if the latter was not in a position to replace the product. 
After about three days, on 24/02/2022 (24th February, 2022), I received a call from the customer care team, but they only provided false promises as the product was not replaced within the 5 days mentioned by the latter. 
Chatbot: Have you considered sending them a notice? 
User: Yes, I sent them a notice dated 02/03/2022, but I have not received any reply from them
User: In my case, who is liable? Product manufacturer or Product seller? 
Chatbot: Thanks for the question. Both are liable. Please ensure you add both the parties as respondents in your complaint. 
User: Noted. Thanks
