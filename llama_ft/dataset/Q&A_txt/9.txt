Chatbot:  Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you.
User:  I've been facing a lot of trouble with a parcel I sent to my husband in Mexico.
Chatbot: Could you elaborate the issue by mentioning the details.
User: I packed all the items my husband requested and went to International Couriers Services Shipping World Wide on 10th June 2021. They informed me that the parcel would be sent through Jet Dart Express Couriers, who have branches abroad.
Chatbot: And did you submit all the necessary documents for the shipment?
User: Yes, I arranged for an invoice as requested by International Couriers Services on 12th August 2021, and submitted it to them on 13th August 2021. They assured me that the parcel would reach my husband on time and issued a receipt for Rs.7,900, fixing the delivery date as 23rd October 2021.
Chatbot: What happened after that?
User: Unfortunately, the parcel was never delivered to my husband. Despite being sent two months before the scheduled delivery date, it never reached him. I tried contacting Jet Dart Express Couriers, but their helpline numbers were always busy.
Chatbot: I see. And what did you do after realizing that the parcel was not delivered?
User: I issued a legal notice to both International Couriers Services and Jet Dart Express Couriers on 9th February 2022, but they didn't respond. That's why I've decided to file  a complaint.
Chatbot: Thank you for providing me with all this information. I could assist you with drafting a complaint and provide a step by step guideline to file a complaint. However, I would like to suggest that you also have an option of contacting the agent through the Consumer Helpline Number and address your grievance.
