Chatbot:Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you. 

User: Hi Chatbot. I need help with filing a consumer complaint. I purchased a motor pump set for agricultural use which has now been damaged.

Chatbot: Can you tell me about the item you purchased and the issue you are facing?

User: I purchased a MARATHIN MAK 10 HP 1440 RPMTEF motor pump set for Rs. 20,750 from a dealer named Balaji Agricultural Agencies located at Secunderabad. I bought this on 23rd September 2020 for agricultural use in my fields and was under the warranty. 

Chatbot: Could you please share more details like the warranty period and invoice number if available?

User: Yes, the motor pump set was under a warranty period of 1 year from the date of purchase. I have the original purchase invoice, - the invoice is numbered 45621 dated 23/09/2020.

Chatbot: Thank you for providing the warranty and invoice details. Now, can you explain what exactly is the issue you are facing with this motor pump set?

User: The motor pump set worked fine initially. But within a few months of purchase, it started giving some problems. It would make loud noises and eventually stopped working completely after some time. Since it was within the 1 year warranty period, I wanted to get it repaired by the dealer under warranty.

Chatbot: Okay. Did you contact the dealer regarding this?

User: Yes, I approached the dealer and requested them to repair it under warranty. They asked me to send the motor to them and they would repair and return it. But  the motor got  damaged in transit. 

Chatbot: Alright. Can you please explain how you sent the defective motor pump set to the dealer? 

User: For transporting the motor pump set, I used a transportation company named Navata Road Transport. On 22nd January 2021, I booked the item through them and sent it to the dealer for repairs.

Chatbot: I see. Please provide more details about Navata Road Transport - their address, waybill number etc. Also, how much value did you declare for the motor pump set while booking the transportation?

User: Navata Road Transport is located in Nagarkurnool, their main office address is Door No. 18-667, Bose Buildings, Kanuru, Vijayawada. I booked the item via their Nagarkurnool branch. The waybill number is SO94101-1 dated 22/01/2021. As for declared value, I specified Rs. 5,000 while booking the transportation through them.

Chatbot: Thank you for the transportation details. You mentioned the motor pump set reached the dealer in a damaged condition. Can you please elaborate what kind of damage had occurred?

User: Yes, when the motor pump reached the dealer, it was completely damaged. The base and body were bent and crushed, the terminal plate was broken, and the motor was in completely unrepairable condition. The dealer informed me that due to the extensive transit damage, they cannot accept or repair it under warranty.

Chatbot: Did you follow up with Navata Road Transport regarding this damage? 

User: I immediately contacted Navata Road Transport and questioned them about how the motor was damaged so badly during transit. But they did not give any satisfactory response regarding this. They also refused to take any responsibility for the damage.

Chatbot: What did Navata Road Transport convey when you contacted them? Did they inspect the damaged motor pump set?

User: When I called them and complained, they simply denied any liability. They insisted the motor pump was in fine condition when transported and refused to even inspect the damaged item. I got no proper response despite multiple complaints to Navata Road Transport.

Chatbot: In this scenario, did you take up this issue with the dealer as well?

User: Yes, I informed the dealer Balaji Agricultural Agencies about how the motor was damaged during transit by Navata Road Transport. I requested them to address this issue and arrange for repairs under warranty as promised. However, they also refused to take any responsibility in the matter.

Chatbot: Alright, so neither the transportation company nor the dealer were helpful in getting this resolved. Can you summarise the loss you have incurred due to this damaged motor pump set?

User: Due to the motor being damaged, I have suffered a huge loss. Firstly, I have lost the cost of the motor pump set itself, which is Rs. 20,750 that I spent to purchase it. Secondly, I have not been able to carry out agricultural activities properly without the motor pump set, leading to production losses. I estimate the production losses to be around Rs. 1 lakh.

Chatbot: Thank you for patiently providing the full details. Given the facts of the case, I would recommend sending a legal notice to both the transport company Navata Road Transport and the dealer Balaji Agricultural Agencies under the Consumer Protection Act 2019. I can assist you in drafting the complaint. Would you like me to proceed with preparing a draft consumer complaint?

User: Yes please, I would like you to draft the consumer complaint on my behalf against both the transporter and dealer to seek compensation for my losses. Please include all the relevant details we discussed.
