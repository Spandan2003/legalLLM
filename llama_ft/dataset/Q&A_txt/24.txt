Chatbot: Hi! I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. Kindly let me know how I can help you. 

User : Hello. I'm Mr. P.V. Dhananjayudu, an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army. I need help regarding an issue I'm facing with the Municipal Corporation of Mahabubnagar. They are not providing me the tax exemption on my house that I'm eligible for as an ex-serviceman.

Chatbot: I understand. Let's discuss this in detail so I can understand the full context and provide the best assistance. Could you please confirm your name, age, address and occupation for my records?

User: Sure,I'm 71 years old and reside at Plot No.3, H.No.8-6-8/A/20, Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar town and district. I'm an ex-serviceman of the Indian Army.

Chatbot:. Could you please explain from the beginning how you became eligible for this tax exemption?

User : Yes, of course. So as part of the rehabilitation program for ex-servicemen, the State Government had allotted me 200 sq yards of land in Survey No. 211/2 at Srinivasa Colony, Mahabubnagar under the ex-servicemen quota. After the land allotment, I constructed a house after taking the required permission from the Mahabubnagar Municipal Corporation, who are the Opposite Party in my complaint. They had provided the construction permission vide letter no. L.R.No.61/BA/298/1046/99 dated 04.02.2000.The Municipal Corporation allotted house number 8-6-8/A/20 for the property after it was constructed. As per government order G.O.Ms.No.83 issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department, dated 15.03.1997, ex-servicemen of the armed forces are eligible for exemption from payment of house tax for one residential property. So based on this government, I am eligible for exemption as an ex-serviceman.

Chatbot: What steps did you take to apply for this tax exemption from the Municipal Corporation?

User : I had submitted all the required documents to the Municipal Corporation requesting them to provide me the tax exemption. This includes my ex-serviceman ID proofs, property documents and the Government Order document itself. I submitted this request first on 26.09.2020. Unfortunately, the Municipal Corporation did not accept my application. In fact, on 18.09.2022, before I applied, they had sent me a tax demand notice asking me to pay Rs. 2637 as the annual house tax.. After they sent that demand notice, I submitted another request on 27.09.2022 explaining my eligibility criteria again and asking them to reconsider.

Chatbot: You have the option to send a legal notice or file a complaint. 

User: Kindly draft me a legal notice. 

Chatbot: For this I will  need the address of the Municipal corporation, kindly provide its address. 

User:The Municipal Commissioner, Mahabubnagar Municipality, Mahabubnagar, Telangana.

Chatbot: Here is the draft notice that you can send to the Municipality in order to get the tax exemption. Remember to put your signature before you send it in hard copy and put e-signature in case you are sending the soft copy.

You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

User: Thank you. But what if the legal notice does not get me any remedy. 

Chatbot: Then you may file a consumer complaint. What remedy would you like to have from the consumer court. 

User: As a relief I want the opposite party to cancel the house tax demand and issue house tax exemption certificate to the complainant also  ask for Rs. 10000/- Rs as compensation for mental agony and inconvenience caused;

Chatbot: I will draft the complaint.. The jurisdiction for the complaint will be Mahabubnagar as the complainant resides there and the opposite party has office at Mahabubnagar . Kindly, upload the relevant documents. The complaint will be filed in District Consumer Disputes Redressal Mahabubnagar as it has the jurisdiction in the present matter.

The Opposite Party, instead of issuing the certificate, issued a demand notice on 18.9.2022 for Rs.2,637 as house tax.
