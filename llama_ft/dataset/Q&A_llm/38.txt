<s><INST> My consignment arrived late, and I was charged an exorbitant price for the delivery. What is my remedy now?  
</INST> Hi, thanks for reaching out to Consumer Grievance Chatbot, a one-stop destination for legal advice regarding consumer grievances. To help me serve you better, could you please provide me with more details regarding the incident?  
</s> <s><INST> On 08/02/2022, one Renaissance  Private Limited booked a consignment for delivery to my company. As per the receipt issued, I was supposed to receive the parcel on 10/02/2022, but I received it only on 15/02/2022. Also, I was charged Rs 1000 for it when the usual price quoted for it is less than that (Rs 800). 
</INST> Did you pay the amount? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did.
</INST> Firstly, in order to come under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019, you will have to show that you have not received this parcel as part of your routine business transactions. Could you please confirm the same? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, this was a one-time purchase from the consignor, and was not related to our business. 
</INST> Okay. Did you check with them about the reason for the delay and also the price charged? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did not get any satisfactory reply. 
</INST> The prices charged may vary based on the size, weight and material sought to be delivered, so you may want to make sure you have proof to demonstrate that you were charged an exorbitant price. 
</s> <s><INST> Okay. Something similar happened to another person, does that count? 
</INST> It may, but it depends on the product that was in question in that incident. 
</INST> When did you bring the price issue to the attention of the delivery service company? At the time of booking or receiving the parcel? 
</s> <s><INST> I could not raise it at the time of booking as the consignor did not inform the price that was charged.
</INST> Okay. I understand. Did you ask them for a refund of the excess amount charged, and compensation for the delay in delivery?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did. I brought it up on 15/02/2022, but I was told that the delay was due to unforeseen circumstances, and that prices were a matter of discretion. 
</s> <s><INST> I also approached the customer support team, but didn't get a favorable response. 
</INST> Okay. Did you consider sending them a legal notice?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I sent them a notice dated 20/02/2022, but I have not received any reply from them
</INST> Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I would like to.
