<s><INST> I placed an order for an oven from a home appliances company but didn’t receive the product.
</INST> Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you? 
</s> <s><INST> I purchased the product from ABC Home Appliances Private Limited on 05/03/2022. I was told that the product would be delivered within 5 working days from the date of purchase, but it has been over 15 days now, but I have not received it yet. 
</INST> Is there anything else that you would like to add about the transaction? 
</s> <s><INST> Made a down payment of the purchase cost  by way of NEFT (Transaction ID: 12456783) on 05/03/2022; received an e-receipt on 06/02/2022 by way of email
</INST> How much did you pay for the product? 
</s> <s><INST> I paid Rs 30,000 for it. 
</INST> Any pending installments in respect of the product? 
</s> <s><INST> No, I made a down payment of the entire cost of the product.
</INST> Okay. Did you bring it to the attention of the seller? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes. On 10/03/2022, I sent a reminder to the seller, but there was no response to the email sent. Then, on 15/03/2022, I raised the issue with the customer care division of the company. I was told that the matter would be resolved within two working days, but I have still not received the product. 
</s> <s><INST> On 24/03/2022, I received a call from the customer support team, this time only to inform that the matter would be closed. When I pointed out that I had still not received the product, they simply stated that they would escalate the issue to the relevant persons for looking into the issue. 
</INST> Did you consider sending a legal notice to the seller? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I sent a legal notice dated 20/03/2022 but it went in vain. I did not receive a reply from the company. 
</INST> Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I would like to.
</INST> Okay, could you please tell me where your residence is?
