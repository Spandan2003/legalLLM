<s><INST> My pant got torn due to a sharp object that was present in one of the seats in a bus. Can I get compensation? 
</INST> Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you? 
</s> <s><INST> I was traveling from Cosmos to Infinity in a bus that belonged to ABC Travels Private Limited when my pant came in contact with a sharp object attached to one of the seats in the second row. 
</INST> Could you please specify the date of the incident? 
</s> <s><INST> 03/03/2022
</INST> Did you pay for the ride? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes 
</INST> How much? 
</s> <s><INST> Rs 250 
</INST> Do you have the ticket with you? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I do 
</INST> Would you be able to describe the object? Was it permanently fixed or temporarily attached? 
</s> <s><INST> I’m not sure, but does that even matter? 
</INST> I understand. Your answer would help me decide whether the incident that occurred could have been avoided but for the presence of the object. 
</s> <s><INST> I would not have been able to avoid coming into contact with the object as I was allotted a seat in the second row 
</INST> Was there an option for you to change your seat? 
</s> <s><INST> The bus was full, and hence there was no option to change my seat. 
</INST> When did you notice a defect in the seat? When did you bring it to the notice of the conductor? 
</s> <s><INST> As soon as I boarded the bus 
</INST> What was their response? 
</s> <s><INST> They pacified me by stating that it was a blunt object and that it would not cause any damage to any of my belongings or injury to me. Besides, I was left with no choice as I was traveling to attend an important event that was scheduled to take place the very next day in the city of Infinity. 
When my destination arrived, I got up to take my bags, and that’s when the object came in contact with my pant and tore it.
</INST> Did you inform the conductor?  
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did, he said that I would have to raise the matter with the management, and that he would not be able to do anything about it 
</INST> Did you raise the matter with the management? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did that too. On 04/02/2022, I got in touch with the management via email and asked them for compensation for the damage caused to my pant. 
</INST> What was their reply? 
</s> <s><INST> They simply stated that I should have been more careful, and that it was not their fault. 
</INST> Did you consider sending them a notice? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I sent a notice dated 10/03/2022 requesting compensation for the damage caused to my pant, but did not receive a reply. 
</INST> Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum?
