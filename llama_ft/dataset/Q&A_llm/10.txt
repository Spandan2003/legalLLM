<s><INST>I have encountered an issue with a recent purchase I made, and I believe I may need legal assistance to address it.
</INST> Of course, I'm here to help. Please, tell me more about what happened.
</s> <s><INST> Well, I recently purchased a KTM motorcycle from Varun Motors here in Visakhapatnam. However, when I received the receipt, I noticed that they had charged me an additional Rs. 3000 for miscellaneous expenses, which I hadn't agreed to.
</INST> I see. Did you raise this concern with Varun Motors?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did. When I protested and refused to pay the extra amount, they threatened not to deliver the motorcycle on the same day as promised. Feeling pressured, I reluctantly paid the amount and took delivery of the vehicle.
</INST> That sounds like a frustrating situation. What happened next?
</s> <s><INST> After taking delivery of the motorcycle, I approached Varun Motors again to request a refund of the extra amount they had charged me. They did return Rs. 2500 to me but claimed they were retaining Rs. 500 as handling charges. However, they hadn't done anything to justify these charges.
</INST> That does seem unfair. Have you taken any steps to address this issue with Varun Motors?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I issued a legal notice to them, requesting the return of the extra amount they charged me. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any response from them.
</INST> I see. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you have grounds to file a consumer complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, or you could also contact the respective State Consumer Helpline Number where you can talk to an agent and address your grievance. 
</s> <s><INST> Could you provide me the helpline number
</INST> To be specific, there is a National and State Consumer Helpline Number. Which number do you want me to provide you with.
</s> <s><INST>  Provide me with the National Consumer Helpline Number.
</INST> Please find the National Consumer Helpline number- 1800-11-4000.
</s> <s><INST> How do I proceed, if I have to file a complaint.
</INST> I need to gather some additional details from you to draft the complaint. Can you provide me with your full name, age, and address for the complaint?
</s> <s><INST> Certainly. My full name is Chippada Jagadeesh Kumar, I'm 30 years old, and I reside at D. No. 1-19, Kondapu Street, Near Grama Panchayat Office, Bhogapuram Mandal, Vizianagaram District-531162.
</INST> Thank you. And could you confirm the date of purchase of the motorcycle and the amount you paid?
</s> <s><INST> I purchased the motorcycle on August 25, 2020, and I paid Rs. 1,42,458 for it.
</INST> Perfect. Now, I'll need some information about Varun Motors for the complaint. Do you have their address and the name of their authorized signatory?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, Varun Motors is located at D. No. 10-50-22/1, Siripuram Junction, Visakhapatnam-530003. Unfortunately, I don't have the name of their authorized signatory.
</INST> That's okay, we can include a generic reference to their authorized representative in the complaint. Lastly, could you provide me with the dates of the refund and the legal notice you sent to Varun Motors?
</s> <s><INST> Sure. Varun Motors refunded Rs. 2500 to me on August 31, 2020, and I issued the legal notice on September 5, 2020.
</INST> Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are seeking for.
</s> <s><INST>  I would like to seek Rs.500/- collected towards handling charges, Rs.1,00,000/- towards compensation for the mental agony, Rs.1,00,000/- towards compensation for deficiency in service, Rs.10,000/- towards costs and any other relief which I am eligible for.
