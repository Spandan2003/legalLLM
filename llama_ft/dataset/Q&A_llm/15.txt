<s><INST>  Hi. I have grievances related to injuries and losses suffered by my minor daughter due to an electrical accident at her school. I need help understanding the process and drafting the complaint. Can you guide me?

</INST> Absolutely, I'm happy to assist. Let's start by gathering all the relevant details, so I have a clear understanding before drafting the complaint. Could you please confirm your name, age, address and occupation and your daughter's name, age and address.

</s> <s><INST>  Sure. My name is Marri Jagga Rao, my age is 38 years and I reside at Bijjapalli, Kamayyapeta Village, Hukumpeta Mandal, Visakhapatnam. I am an employee at SBI Bank, Hukumpeta Branch. My daughter's name is Marri Roja Rani. She is 13 years old and studies at the Government School in our village, she resides in the same place as I live.

</INST> Thank you for providing those details, Mr. Rao. Could you please elaborate on what happened - when and how did your daughter get injured? This will establish the basic facts of the incident.

</s> <s><INST>  On 16th July 2018 around 9:30 am, my daughter Roja Rani and her friend were playing in the balcony on the 1st floor of their school building. They accidentally touched some high tension wires passing very close to the parapet and got electrocuted. Both girls fell down from the height. While my daughter sustained grievous burn injuries, her friend unfortunately died on the spot.

</INST> I'm very sorry to hear about this tragic incident. Where was your daughter taken for treatment and what was the extent of her injuries? Please provide details about the medical expenses incurred too.

</s> <s><INST>  She was first taken to the Area Hospital in Hukumpeta for first aid. From there she was shifted to K.G Hospital in Vizag on the same day where doctors had to amputate her left leg toes namely, leg great toe, 2nd and 3rd toe and right hand below elbow. The total medical expenses for treatment and medicines was around Rs. 5 lakhs.

</INST> Thank you for the details. Who would you hold responsible for this incident that caused injury and loss to your minor daughter? Please provide complete details of the parties at fault.

</s> <s><INST>  I believe Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL) is responsible as the high tension wires were passing too close to a school balcony, endangering students' lives. The Chairman, Managing Director, Superintending Engineer and Assistant Engineer of the Vizag division should be made opposite parties.

</INST> Did you file an FIR or a complaint against the APEPDCL
</s> <s><INST> Yes. The Hukumpeta Police registered the incident as a case in Crime No.37/2018.

</INST> Got it. When did you issue a legal notice to APEPDCL regarding compensation for your loss? Please provide the date as it will establish the cause of action.

</s> <s><INST>  I issued a legal notice on 21st February 2022 requiring them to pay compensation of Rs. 15 lakhs. But they did not respond even after receiving it.
</INST> You could also seek for the costs of the litigation, i.e expenses incurred.
