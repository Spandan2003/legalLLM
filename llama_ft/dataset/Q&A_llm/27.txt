<s><INST> I was served unhygienic food at the restaurant.
</INST> Can you please explain in detail as to when you went to the restaurant and how the food is unhygienic.
</s> <s><INST>  During COVID 19 I along with my friends went to Tirupati on 06.09.2020, On 7.09.2020 we went to The Perambur Sri Srinivasa Sweets & Snacks, for lunch. There we ordered 5 meals in total and the order number was 22942. The meal consists of rice and vathal kulambu. When lunch was served, I poured the vathal kulambu on rice and noticed a foreign object.
</INST> Did you inform the supervisor or manager of the restaurant about the same?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I informed the supplier, supervisor and the manager, Mr. SArangabani and even showed them the rice having a piece of wire and expressed my displeasure about the unhygienic food served. But they didn’t provide any alternative meals nor did they take any remedial measures to insure the good quality food is served to the customer. 
</INST> Do you have any copy of the bill for the lunch you had at Perambur Sri Srinivasa Sweets & Snack.
</s> <s><INST>  Yes, after having lunch the opposite party has issued the bill no 22671 which mentions the total cost of lunch was Rs. 517/-
</INST> Thank you for the information. This is a case of deficiency of service on part of the restaurant. You have few options going forward. You can go for mediation and settlement of dispute outside the court or alternatively you can directly file a consumer complaint and claim compensation for the same. 

</s> <s><INST> I don’t want to go for mediation as I have already approached the other party to resolve the issue, but to no avail. I would like to file a complaint with the consumer forum. What is the procedure to approach the consumer forum?

</INST>To proceed with filing a consumer complaint, it is essential to gather additional details. Could you please provide your full name, occupation, contact information, and residential address for documentation purposes?

</s> <s><INST> My name is K.karthikeyan, S/o Kothandaraman, I am a government teacher by profession and you can reach me at Contact no. 9309710258. I am a resident of No.217, West Masi Street, Madurai..

</INST> Thank you for providing your details. In order to strengthen your case, it would be helpful to know if you have any photographic evidence of the foreign object found in the food, as well as any records of your communication with the restaurant management

</s> <s><INST> Unfortunately, I did not capture any photographs, but I do have a video of the incident.As for health issues, none of us experienced immediate discomfort, but the presence of a foreign object in the meal was alarming.

</INST>. Additionally, did you witness any health-related issues or discomfort due to the unhygienic food?

</s> <s><INST> I was fine and did not face any health issues. 

</INST> Now, let's discuss the procedure for filing a consumer complaint. Consumer complaints are typically filed with the district or state consumer forum. You can file a complaint at Madurai or Tirupathi. Which place do you prefer?

</s> <s><INST> I would prefer to file the complaint with the consumer forum in Madurai, as that is where I reside. Additionally, how much compensation is reasonably expected from  the opposite party and what is the procedure to file a complaint.

</INST> Madurai is a reasonable choice. The compensation depends on what evidence we produce in the consumer forum, the bill amount, the distress caused to the consumer by deficiency of service are taken into consideration for calculating the compensation. In this case I think you should claim a compensation of Rs. 20000/- for the deficiency in service and causing mental agony to the complainant.
