<s><INST> Hello Chatbot. I purchased some silver jewellery from a shop recently but I faced some issues regarding deduction of weight and purity of the products. I want to file a consumer complaint in the consumer court but need help understanding the process.

</INST> Sure, I would be happy to guide you through the entire process. But first, let me understand the full details of what happened. When did you make this jewellery purchase and give a description of the purchase? 

</s> <s><INST> I purchased 2 pairs of silver leg chains and 2 pairs of silver metti tags on 1st January 2022 from Lalitha Jewellery Mart in Madurai. The total bill amount was Rs. 11,013.

</INST> Okay. And from the options, I show below, what best describes how you made the payment for this purchase?

1. Full payment in cash 
2. Part cash, part old jewellery exchange
3. Full old jewellery exchange

</s> <s><INST> I did part payment in cash and part by exchange of my old silver chain. 

</INST> Understood. Could you please confirm your name, age and full residential address? This is required from a jurisdiction perspective when filing the case.

</s> <s><INST> My name is V. Ramaraj, age 48 years, residing at Pasumpon Nagar, Madurai.

</INST> Thanks for confirming. So you exchanged an old silver chain while purchasing the new jewellery on 1st Jan 2022. What was the net weight of this old chain? 

</s> <s><INST> The old silver chain weighed approximately 201 grams which I had purchased from the same Lalitha Jewellery shop about 1 year back.

</INST> Okay. And what was the issue you faced during this exchange? Please explain the problem in detail.

</s> <s><INST> As per standard market practice, while exchanging old silver items, shops deduct some weight for wastage and pay as per latest market rate for remaining net weight. In my case, when valuing the 201 grams old silver chain for exchange, the shop should have deducted 4 grams for dust wastage which is reasonable. But apart from 4 grams they also deducted 59 grams over and above this claiming it as processing wastage charges. So they calculated the exchange value only for the remaining 138 grams instead of at least 197 grams (201 grams - 4 grams dust charges). This 59 grams deduction was very unreasonable and resulted in financial loss to me.

</INST> According to you this 59 grams deduction is beyond normal standards and unacceptable?

</s> <s><INST> Yes, absolutely! As a consumer, I felt cheated. The silver jewellery that is 201 grams was brought from the same shop and I paid for the full 201 grams so when I exchanged it I should have got an appropriate return on the exchanged silver. 

</INST> Noted. Usually 5-10% is the max wastage deduction, not 30%. I should have got a value of at least 197 grams after allowing 4 grams for dust. We have the option to send a legal notice and file a consumer complaint.

</s> <s><INST> I also have another issue related to the same transaction.

</INST> Please elaborate in detail.

</s> <s><INST> Yes, another problem I faced was that the 190 grams new silver leg chain I purchased as part of this purchase broke in just a few days! It looks like the new silver chain given to me was made of impure silver. 

</INST> I understand. We can send the legal notice or file a complaint for both the issues as they are part of the same transaction.

</s> <s><INST>kindly draft legal notice and the complaint. 

</INST> Can you please confirm your occupation and address

</s> <s><INST> V.Ramaraj, S/o. Varadarajulu, Age-45, Occupation: Sub-inspector, r/o Pasumpon Nagar, Madurai.

</INST> Can you please confirm the opposite party's address.

</INST> As both the parties reside in Madurai, the district consumer redressal commission Madurai will have the jurisdiction to try the case. 
What remedy would you like to seek from the court, like replacement of impure silver or compensation or both?

</s> <s><INST> I want compensation for the 59 grams of silver, for which the payment was not made. Further I want compensation of 5 lakh for causing stress and mental agony.
