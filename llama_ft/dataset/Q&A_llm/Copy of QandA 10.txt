<s><INST> I have faced problem with SpiceJet Airline
</INST> That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, on 12/02/2021 I had booked air tickets from Goa to Delhi for 4 passengers via Spicejet website. The PNR number was 28283855 and I paid Rs. 5,000 for the booking.
</INST> Do you have the ticket confirmation and payment proof?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I have taken printouts of the booking confirmation email and payment receipt.
</INST> Okay, so what happened next?
</s> <s><INST> Shockingly, the airline cancelled all the tickets without any intimation or consent from my side. I got to know only when I called to reconfirm.
</INST> Did they provide any reason for the cancellation when you contacted them?
</s> <s><INST> No, the customer care had no clue and gave no explanation on why the booked tickets were cancelled unilaterally. This caused immense harassment to me and my family.
</INST> That is really strange. When were you supposed to travel as per the booking?
</s> <s><INST> The travel date booked was 25th February 2021. I got the cancellation news just 2 days before travel.
</INST> Okay, and what compensation are you seeking from them?
</s> <s><INST> This last minute cancellation led to huge financial losses as I had to book fresh tickets at higher cost. I am seeking a refund of Rs. 5,000 for the booking amount, along with ₹20,000 as compensation for harassment and additional expenses incurred.
</INST> You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to Spice Jet Airlines. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000. The Consumer Helpline will give assistance regarding how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?
