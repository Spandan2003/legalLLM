<s><INST> Hello. I need help regarding an insurance claim that has been rejected. My husband unfortunately passed away last year in a tractor accident and I'm unable to get the insurance settlement from the company.  

</INST> I'm sorry to hear about your husband. Let's discuss this in detail so I can understand the full situation and provide you the best assistance. Could you confirm your name, age, full address and occupation? 

</s> <s><INST> Sure, my name is Jalakanti Radha, age 43 years, occupation agriculture. I reside at House No. 2-42, Chikkepally Village, Pangal Mandal, Wanaparthy District, Mahabubnagar, Telangana - 509120.

</INST> Thank you for providing your details. You mentioned your husband passed away in a tractor accident. Can you please describe it in detail?

</s> <s><INST> The incident happened on 19th February 2021. My husband Jalakanti Madhu used to go for agricultural soil digging and transport work on his tractorOn 19th February evening around 5:30pm, my husband Madhu was digging and loading soil on the tractor at Bhakoni Thippa. During this work, the tractor accidentally slipped and fell over him. He came under the tractor and died on the spot due to the accident. We informed the local Pangal police station about the incident. They registered an FIR under section 304A IPC and did the inquest,  postmortem and other procedural formalities. 
</INST> Can you specify the details of the insurance policy, like policy number, validity period, accidental cover and with whom were you insured?

</s> <s><INST> My husband had taken an insurance policy from ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The policy number is 3008/195832894/00 which was valid from 3rd March 2020 to 2nd March 2021. It included a personal accident cover of ₹15 lakhs for the owner-driver of the tractor. 

</INST> what step did you take once you realised that the accident was covered under insurance?
</s> <s><INST> Immediately after the incident I informed ICICI Lombard by calling them and also submitted the claim forms. I followed up continuously after that also. The company kept delaying and did not settle the claim. Initially on 15th June 2022 they replied that the claim will be processed but after that no response even after multiple follow-ups. It has been over a year now but I'm yet to receive any claim settlement.

</INST> That is concerning. You can send a legal notice to the ICICI Lombard. May I draft a legal notice  for you?

</s> <s><INST> Yes, kindly draft legal notice for me.

</INST> Please share the address details of the insurance company, you have already given your address details may I use the same or should I change. 

</s> <s><INST> My address is the same. The address of the insurance company is:ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd., 2nd Floor, Shop No. 1-7,   18-20, Lumbini Jewel Mall,   Road No. 2, Banjara Hills,Hyderabad, Telangana – 500034.

</INST> Could you please specify what relief you expect from the opposite party?

</s> <s><INST> Would like the insurance company to immediately process and settle my valid personal accident insurance claim of Rs.15,00,000/ and pay a compensation amount of Rs.2,00,000/- for mental agony and financial hardship caused due to deficiency in service. Apart from this I would like to ask for the litigation cost.
