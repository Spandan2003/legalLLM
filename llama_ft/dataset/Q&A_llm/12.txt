<s><INST> I have an issue with one of my insurance policies. Help me in claiming the amount.
Chabot: Let's start by discussing the details of your case. 
</s> <s><INST>  I have taken 5 insurance policies from LIC over the years while I was working in different bus departments before retiring in July 2019. When I went to pay the premiums in July 2019, I was informed by LIC that the policy was not in my name but in the name of "Adapa Nookaratnam," a resident of Anakapalli.	
</INST> That sounds like a concerning situation. Could you please mention the details of the insurance policy in concern. 
</s> <s><INST>Policy number 692299503 has a 25-year term with a death benefit of Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 19,500 respectively for a monthly premium of Rs. 65. The premium is due on the 28th of every month, and it also includes a free insurance cover of Rs. 25,000. 
</INST> Could you please mention the maturity date of the policy.
</s> <s><INST> The date of policy maturity is 28/08/2021, and the last premium payment date was scheduled on 28/07/2021.
Chabot: Did LIC provide any explanation for this discrepancy?
</s> <s><INST> No, they did not provide any satisfactory reasons when I inquired about it. They simply delayed addressing the issue until the policy's maturity date. 
Chabot: I see. And did LIC provide you with any information regarding the maturity benefits of the policy?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, Upon repeated requests on 01/06/2021 the LIC gave a statement under reference:6981 showing an amount of Rs. 4,875 as the maturity benefit. However, this amount was not in accordance with the policy's terms and conditions, and when I raised my concerns, LIC and their subordinates did not respond appropriately.
Chabot: Can you tell me about your attempts to resolve this issue with LIC 
</s> <s><INST> I have visited LIC's offices around 20 times in the past two years, despite receiving a meager pension of Rs. 6,000 per month. It has caused me a lot of mental agony, and despite my efforts, LIC has not addressed the issue satisfactorily. Thus, I have issued a Legal notice on 03/12/2021.
</INST> Did you receive any response from LIC after issuing a legal notice?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, LIC responded to the legal notice on 24/12/2021, stating that they did not receive premiums for 2 years due to my long leave, which was not communicated to me earlier. They also refused to supply the statement of premiums paid by me from 2013 to my retirement in July 2019. However, a letter was issued on 25/02/2022 stating that they have received premiums for 116 months, i.e, for 9.6 years since inception and the amount payable to the complainant is around Rs.7,500. They have deliberately not intimated the non receipt premiums to the and also refused to supply the statement of premiums which I paid from the year 2013, till the date of my retirement i.e, on 31/07/2019. 
Chabot: I understand your concerns. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are seeking for?
</s> <s><INST> I would like to seek the insurance amount Rs.19,500 assured under the policy No. 692299503, Rs.2,00,000 as compensation for the mental agony and Rs.10,000 as costs.
