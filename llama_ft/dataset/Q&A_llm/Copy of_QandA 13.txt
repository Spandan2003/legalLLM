<s><INST> The bank, from which I availed loan has been charging high interest 
</INST> That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, thank you. I had taken a home loan of Rs. 7 lakhs (Account no. 531506650018340) from Union Bank in 2005 for construction of my house.
</INST> Do you have the loan agreement and other documents?
</s> <s><INST> Yes I have the full loan agreement. As per it, the interest rate was fixed at Rs. 3,158 per month for 240 months and the EMI was Rs. 6,100.
</INST> Alright. How much have you paid against the loan until now?
</s> <s><INST> I have paid over Rs. 12 lakhs over the last 15+ years but as per the bank's statements, they are showing an outstanding amount as Rs. 6,56,000!
</INST> How is that possible when you have already paid much more than the original loan amount?
</s> <s><INST> Exactly! I have been following up with the bank for the last 6 months but they are insisting that I still owe them this amount as per their records.
</INST> This seems to be a clear case of harassment and fabrication of documents by the bank. Do you have the payment receipts and bank statements?
</s> <s><INST> Yes I have all the documents ready to show the payments made.
</INST> You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to Union Bank of India.
