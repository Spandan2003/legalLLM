<s><INST> Service centre of the TV showroom from where I purchased my TV is refusing to repair it now. 
</INST> That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the issues that you are facing with your landline phone?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, thank you. I purchased a Haier 32-inch LED TV, model number LE32K6600GAw, on 20/10/2021 vide bill number 106. I paid Rs. 20,000 for it after exchanging my old TV for Rs. 2,000.
</INST> Do you have the purchase invoice?
</s> <s><INST> Yes I have the original invoice along with me. The TV was working fine at the time of purchase.
</INST> Okay. When did the issue arise?
</s> <s><INST> The problem started on 29/03/2022. Within the warranty period, the TV display started giving problems.
</INST> What exact problems did you notice with the TV display?
</s> <s><INST> The display started showing vertical and horizontal flickering lines. The picture became distorted.
</INST> Alright. What steps did you take to get this resolved?
</s> <s><INST> I immediately informed the Pereira Electronics showroom about the issue on 30/03/2022. As advised, I also sent them photographs of the faulty display.
</INST> And what was their response?
</s> <s><INST> Shockingly, their technician dismissed it as physical damage without even looking at the TV. He refused service claiming I had damaged it externally.
</INST> Did you get any report or proof from them about external damage?
</s> <s><INST> No, there was no physical damage at all! The TV was under normal use. Still they refused service citing physical damage.
</INST> Okay, thank you for the information. You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to  Pereira Electronics and Electricals. The same can be sent electronically or by post. Or else, you can also contact the  National  Consumer Helpline using the helpline number 1800-11-4000. The Consumer Helpline will give assistance regarding how you can approach the present dispute. What would you prefer?
