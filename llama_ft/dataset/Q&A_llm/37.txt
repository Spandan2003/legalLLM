<s><INST> I incurred extra expenses on my flight journey from the US to India due to negligent conduct of the travel agency. What should I do now? 
</INST> Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you? 
</s> <s><INST> As per the original itinerary, my return journey from the US to India was scheduled to take place on the 15th of March, 2022. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to arrive earlier than expected, so I had asked the travel agent to prepone the date of departure to 8th March, 2022. However, due to some issues with respect to the transit visa arrangements, I had to shell out an extra sum of money, and also  could not reach India on time to fulfill my personal commitments. 
</INST> How much did you have to pay extra for the return journey? 
</s> <s><INST>I was asked to pay Rs 80,000 which I paid on 04/03/2022.
</INST> Okay. What is the name of the travel agency? 
</s> <s><INST> Vista Travel Agency Private Limited 
</INST> Could you please share your flight details? 
    </s> <s><INST> Airline: Sunset Airlines 
    PNR details: 
    India UserSA – XXXXXX
    UserSA to India - XXXXXX
   Date of departure from India: - 01/03/2022  
   Original date of departure from the UserS: - 15/03/2022

   Flight fare (India to US) – Rs 1, 05, 000/- 
   Flight fare (US to India) – Rs 1, 10, 000/-
</INST> Did you raise the matter with the travel agency? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did. I contacted their customer care on 15/03/2022. They said there was no mistake on their side, and that they had done all that was necessary. 
</INST> What was the response of the airline authorities? 
</s> <s><INST> They could not help me as the journey details were not updated in their system, so I was forced to pay an extra sum of money to the airline directly for rebooking the flight ticket. I had to pay Rs 80,000 for the same. 
</INST> Did you consider sending them a legal notice? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I sent a notice dated 20/03/2022 to the travel agency,  but never received a reply to the notice
