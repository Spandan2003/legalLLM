<s><INST> I was sold a defective TV. What is my remedy now? 
</INST> Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
</s> <s><INST> I placed an order on XYZ e-commerce portal for a 55’ smart TV on 12/02/2022. I paid the cost price of Rs 60,000/- by way of NEFT (Transaction ID 67346281) and the scheduled delivery date was 14/02/2022 with a 10-day return policy. The TV was delivered on 16/02/2022 and installed on 18/02/2022. However, on 20/02/2022, the TV got switched off automatically while in use, and after that I could not boot up the device at all. 
</INST> Okay. Could you please provide me with details regarding the name and registered office address of the manufacturer and the seller of the product? 
</s> <s><INST> Manufacturer: Comet Manufacturers, 14/305, 8th street, Vimala Nagar, Cosmos-60
           Seller: Waves Home Appliances Private Limited, 12/301, 3rd street, Simala Nagar, Cosmos – 30 
</INST> Could you also provide the product specifications? 
</s> <s><INST> Type: QLED Smart TV 
           Size: 55’ 
           Resolution: HD 4k
            Model Number: AS345678
</s> <s><INST> I have a doubt. In my case, who is responsible? E-commerce platform, Product Seller or Product Manufacturer? 
</INST> Thanks for the question. All three might be jointly and severally liable 
</INST> Also, did you raise the issue with the e-commerce platform? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did. On 21/02/2022 I contacted the customer support team, and when they asked me as to whether I wanted a replacement, or wanted the defect to be rectified, I said I was okay with anything. In turn, they told me that they would get in touch with the product seller, and that a technician would be sent in a few days’ time. 
</s> <s><INST> But, no one turned up. On 25/02/2022, I sent them an email requesting the platform to replace the defective TV, to which I received a reply stating that a technician would be sent in a few days’ time to look into the issue. 
</INST> Did a technician examine the product? 
</s> <s><INST> On 27/02/2022, a technician from the product seller’s company arrived. He checked the product and stated that the product would have to be replaced due to inherent manufacturing defects. Further, he told me to contact the product seller directly for a replacement. 
</s> <s><INST> On 27/02/2022, I got in touch with the product seller who assured me that a new TV would be installed in place of the defective one as soon as possible, but the TV has still not been replaced.
</INST> Is there anything else that you would like to add?
</s> <s><INST> In fact, I contacted the seller on 03/03/2022 to check if they had any plans of replacing the defective product, but did not receive a favorable response. I also emphasized the dual use of TV for me (source of news and entertainment), but all efforts went in vain. 
</INST> I understand. Did you consider sending a legal notice to the product seller? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I sent a notice dated 10/03/2022, but I haven’t yet received a reply from the seller. 
</INST> Okay. 
</INST> Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum?
