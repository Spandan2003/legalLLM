<s><INST> Hello, I have been deceived by the service centre with regard to service for my bike. 
</INST> I'm sorry to hear that. Can you provide more details about how you were deceived by the service centre and for which bike?
</s> <s><INST> I have a Yamaha Fascino Vehicle, Model no.125 FI hybrid, bearing no. TN-58-AP-7864. I gave it to the authorised service centre at Kochadai, Madurai. I had applied for an “annual maintenance contract”. As per the annual contract I was given 3 free services without any labour charge and 2 free wash. But when I approached the service centre after using 2 free services and one free wash, the third service was supposed to be free but they charged me Rs. 460 for the service instead of giving free service. 
</INST>. Please give additional information, so that I can understand the full timeline of events. What is the name and the address of the service centre where you gave your bike for service? 
</s> <s><INST> M/s. Alagendra Auto, Yamaha Bike Service, No.173-C, Natraj Nagar Main Road,Kochadai, Madurai – 16.
</INST> When did you initially purchase the annual maintenance contract from the Yamaha service centre? How much did you pay for the annual maintenance contract?
</s> <s><INST>: I purchased the annual maintenance contract on January 4, 2021. For a payment of Rs 999, I was supposed to get 3 free services without any labour charges and 2 free water washes. 
</INST> Okay, and on that same initial visit on January 4, did you receive any documentation for the Annual Maintenance purchase and the first free service? Did you avail any free service from the service centre.
</s> <s><INST>Yes, they gave me a receipt for the AMC payment of Rs 999 (Bill #GES8826) and a job card for the first free service (Job Card #60183A). The first service invoice also mentioned the next service would be due on March 4.Yes, I have availed 2 free services but when I went for the 3rd free service the service centre denied me the last free service and charged me labour fees.
</INST>:Great, those receipts will be useful evidence. And when did you go in for the second free service under the AMC?: 
</s> <s><INST> I went in on May 4 for the second service. 
</INST> Understood. It seems up until that point, everything was going smoothly under the contract. When did things go wrong? 
</s> <s><INST> On November 23 when I went for my third service, which should have been free under the AMC. But this time, they charged me labour fees of Rs 460 in the invoice even though I submitted the final coupon.
</INST> And did you keep those coupon receipts safely as they will be used as evidence. 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I have the receipt of the bill that mentions free service on Jan 4 2021 and May 4 2021. 
</INST> I see. So for that third visit, do you have an invoice showing the labour fees which should not have been charged according to the terms of the annual maintenance contract.
</s> <s><INST> Yes, the invoice number is GES8962 and it shows the Rs 1307 that includes Rs 460.20 as labour fee, which should have been free,
</INST> Did you inform the service centre about the extra charge in the invoice for the service of the bike even though the last free service was available to you?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I took up the issue with the manager of the service centre but they did not have any positive reply and withheld my bike and asked me to make full payment of  	Rs. 1,307 which included Rs. 460.20 as labour charge. 
</INST>  Can you also tell on what date you make the payment for the 3rd service and for how much time the bike was withheld by the service provider?
</s> <s><INST> I made the payment for the 3rd service on 20.01.2022. They withhold my bike from 23 Nov. 2021 to 20 Jan 2022. Can you help me with the remedy that I have under the law?
