<s><INST> Hi! I bought a Maruti Suzuki Swift VDI car about three years ago, and I've been having a problem with one of the doors. It got damaged due to rust within the first 13 months, and the company is not willing to repair or replace it.

</INST> Can you please provide your full name, age, occupation, and residential address?

</s> <s><INST> Sure, my name is Sheik Jaffar, I'm 35 years old, I run a small business, and I live at H.No.3-60, Siddapur village, Kothur Mandal, R.R. District – 509338.

</INST> Let's discuss the specifics of the purchase. When did you buy the Swift VDI car, and from which dealership did you make the purchase? What problem did you face with the purchased car?What did you do to redress the issue?

</s> <s><INST> I purchased the car for Rs 7,25,000 on July 18, 2018, from Sri Jayaram Motors Pvt. Ltd., located at Plot Nos. C1 and C2, Industrial Area, Mettugadda, Mahabubnagar - 509001. I first noticed the issue with the car door within the first 13 months of purchase, and I approached the dealer, Sri Jayaram Motors, multiple times regarding the problem from the date of purchase ie. July 18,2018. However, they refused to repair or replace the damaged door. The damage was due to rust, and it affected both the cosmetic appearance and the functionality of the door. I spent Rs. 1,00,000/- that  includes the expenses I had to incur for repairing the damaged door  in Aug 2019. 

</INST> When  you repaired the car door. The one who repaired your car might have informed you about the shortcoming in the design and material used in the manufacturing of the car door that caused the damage to the car door within a short amount of time.

</s> <s><INST> The worker, where I repaired my car, informed me that the use of the galvanised steel is known for its resistance to corrosion, and using it in car bodies can significantly extend the durability of the vehicle. In my case, the rusting of the car door occurred within a relatively short period, indicating a lack of adequate corrosion resistance in the materials used. Despite the company's claim in the owner's manual about the state-of-the-art technology and periodic servicing for optimal results, they failed to address the issue, leading to continued frustration on my part.

</INST> Thank you for sharing that information. Now, let's discuss the evidence you have to support your complaint.?

</s> <s><INST> The invoice serves as proof of the purchase of the Swift VDI car. I have a copy of Service records and job cards establishing my multiple attempts to seek assistance from authorised workshops. Photographs of the damaged door are crucial visual evidence that showcases the extent of the rusting and the need for repairs or replacement.

</INST> Thank you for providing clarity on the evidence.You have the option to send a legal notice or file a complaint. In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

</s> <s><INST> Thank you for sharing the helpline number. Kindly draft me a legal notice. 

</INST> Here is  the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party. But it is to inform you that the opposite party may not agree to the demand that you made in the notice. In such a case you should file a consumer complaint.
</s> <s><INST> Please, tell me the process to file  the consumer complaint. I would like to file a complaint
</INST> Before filing the consumer complaint, you have to consider in what jurisdiction you are going to file the complaint. Now, considering the jurisdiction, You reside in Rangareddi District and the opposite party resides in Mahabubnagar district. Therefore, I believe both the courts have authority to try and entertain my complaint. Which court do you prefer?

</s> <s><INST> I prefer Mahabubnagar court. Please draft the consumer complaint. 

</INST> I will draft a complaint for you but before that I would like to have your input as to what redressal do you seek from the consumer court, you can  ask for replacement of the door or compensation for deficiency of service and the cost for the complaint. 

</s> <s><INST> I would like to ask for the compensation of Rs 1,00,000. The amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- is based on the actual expenses incurred for repairing the damaged door in Aug 2019. I would like to have Rs. 9,15,000/- as for the deficiency in service and hardship I endured. 

</INST> Thank you for providing detailed information, Sheik Jaffar. I believe we have covered all the relevant aspects of your case. Is there anything else you would like to add or clarify before we conclude our conversation?

</s> <s><INST> I believe we've covered everything. I just hope that this process can lead to a fair resolution and compensation for the troubles I've faced with my car.
