<s><INST> Hi. I need help filing a consumer complaint regarding a product I ordered online which turned out to be defective. I sent it back through the registered post as advised but the parcel got lost in transit.

</INST> I understand. Let's take this step-by-step so I can gather all the details to best assist you. Could you start by telling me your name and address?

</s> <s><INST> Sure. My name is T. Kavitha, I'm 35 years old and work as a bank employee at the State Bank of India's Mahabubnagar branch. I reside in Mahabubnagar town in the Mahabubnagar district of Telangana.

</INST> Thank you for providing your details Ms.Kavitha. Can you now explain what product you had ordered online and from which website? What was the defect you noticed?

</s> <s><INST> I had ordered a remote control toy car for my son from Amazon.in 07.01.2019.  It was a "Toy House Fast n Furious Lykan Hypersport Car'' worth ₹12,499. When I received the delivery on 15.01.2019., I found that the car had some manufacturing defect. It was not working properly.

</INST> Okay. Did you inform the seller or Amazon about this product defect? What response did you get?

</s> <s><INST> Yes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer support by email and also left a review detailing the defect. They got back saying I should return the item to them for a refund.

</INST> Alright. Can you share more details about how you returned the defective toy car? Which courier service did you use and do you have any shipment receipt or tracking ID?
</s> <s><INST> Amazon instructed me to send it back through India Post as they have a tie-up. As advised, on 12th Feb 2019, I shipped the product from the Mahabubnagar post office to Amazon's warehouse in Gurgaon, Haryana. It was registered parcel number CA012164954IN and I paid ₹650 postal charges.Even after 2-3 weeks, the tracking status still showed that the parcel was in transit. So I started following up with the post office repeatedly to trace it but there was no proper response.

</INST> I understand. What was the final update you received about your parcel? Did you get any written communication from the post office about it?

</s> <s><INST> After almost 6 months of me persistently following up, the Mahabubnagar post office finally sent me a letter saying my parcel was received in Gurgaon sorting facility but then they lost track of it and couldn't trace it anymore.

</INST> That must have been very frustrating for you. Did the post office offer any compensation or resolution for losing your parcel?

</s> <s><INST> Yes, in their letter dated 23rd September 2019, they said they were closing the case and offered me Rs. 500 as goodwill compensation. I refused to accept it since the toy car was worth ₹12,499. This is totally unfair.

</INST> You're absolutely right. Losing a customer's package is a deficiency in service. Did you take up this issue further with higher authorities in the postal department?

</s> <s><INST> I complained to the senior officials through their public grievance portal. But other than sympathizing, they also did not offer any resolution. 

</INST> It would be good to send a legal notice to the opposite party. Maybe you get the remedy that you were looking for.

</s> <s><INST> Kindly draft a legal  notice. 
</INST> Here is the legal notice that you can send to the opposite party and ask for the sum of Rs. 12,499/- towards the cost of the toy car sent through the registered post and pay Rs.2000 towards the notice. If this also does not work you can look go forward to file a consumer complaint against the opposite party.In case you get any problem in the above process or have any doubt, I would suggest you contact the state consumer helpline at 1800-425-00333 Call centre Assistants are available between 9-30 AM to 6-00 PM on all working days of Government of Telangana or you can call the National Consumer Helpline at 1800-11-4000 for information, advice, or guidance on complaints. You can also call 14404 or send a message to 8130009809. You can also register a complaint through the NCH app. Is there anything else you need?

</s> <s><INST> Please draft a consumer complaint as given the conduct of the opposite party I don't have much hope that the opposite party would give me proper redressal. 

</INST> You have come to the right place, I would draft the complaint. But for this I need some additional information, like the name of the parties, your name and the name of the opposite party, age, occupation, address. In the present case we should make the post office and amazon as the opposite parties. Based on that I would also recommend a jurisdiction in which the complaint can be filed.

</s> <s><INST> Mention my address as Ms. T. Kavitha W/o G. Rajendra Prasad Aged about 35 years
Occupation: Bank Employee  State Bank of India, Mahabubnagar Main Branch Mahabubnagar, Mahabubnagar District and mention the opposite party address as 1.

The Superintendent, Head Post Office Mahabubnagar, Mahabubnagar District

</INST> Based on the information provided you can file a consumer complaint at the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Mahabubnagar and Gurgaon. 

</s> <s><INST> I would  like to file the complaint in Mahabubnagar.
