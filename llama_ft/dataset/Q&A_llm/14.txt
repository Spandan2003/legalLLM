<s><INST> I have issues with my SB Account. Can you help me resolve it.
</INST> Certainly. Could you please provide me with further details 
</s> <s><INST> I've had an SB Account with the State Bank of India, Dondaparthi Branch for many years. Recently, Mr. Sharma, a Senior Associate of the bank,  advised me to open fixed deposits to receive better benefits. Trusting his advice and my faith in the bank, I handed over three cheques, each drawn for Rs. 7,00,000, to Mr. Sharma to have deposits made in the names of my three children.
</INST> And what happened after you handed over the cheques to Mr. Sharma?
</s> <s><INST>  Unfortunately, I did not receive any fixed deposit certificates as expected. Despite my repeated requests and visits to Mr. Sharma, he kept postponing the issuance of the certificates, stating that they were still under process. However, I later discovered that Rs. 3441 each was being credited to my account from 28/11/2017 onwards against an annuity pension scheme, which I never agreed to or signed up for.
</INST> That sounds like a concerning situation. Did you raise your concerns with the Manager or anyone else at the bank?
</s> <s><INST>  Yes, I approached the Branch Manager in February 2018 and informed them that I never requested or agreed to any policies. I also mentioned that even if policies were issued, I never received any documents related to them. I explained that had I been served with the documents, I would have been able to cancel the policies within the free look period.
</INST> Have you received any response from the opposite parties regarding your complaints?
</s> <s><INST>  Unfortunately, despite sending several reminders between 01/10/2019 and 24/07/2021, the opposite parties did not address my concerns or take any action. Finally, on 07/02/2020, they rejected my request to cancel the policies.
</INST> I see. It seems like the opposite parties have not been responsive to your grievances. Could you please mention what is the remedy that you are seeking for.
</s> <s><INST> I would like to seek a refund of Rs.21,00,000/- for the three policies and credit the same into my SB account No. 32906316511, Rs. 3,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony and Rs.20,000/- for costs
