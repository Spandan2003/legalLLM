<s><INST> I paid a sum of money towards annual fees, but I am now unable to recover the money from the educational institution. 
</INST> Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you? 
</s> <s><INST> My child is studying in a private school in the city of Cosmos. As part of the annual fees, I was asked to pay Rs 1,00,000. I paid the amount by way of cheque dated 06/03/2022, but now I have been transferred to another city so I want to withdraw from the admission process. 
</INST> : Okay. At the time of making the payment, were you informed of the refund policy? 
</s> <s><INST> Partly yes. It was not mentioned that under no circumstances would the money be refunded. 
</INST> Did you find out about the existence of any exception under special circumstances? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, but it was not helpful
</INST> Did you mention your reason for withdrawing from the admission process? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, on 20/07/2022, I brought it to the notice of the institution, but they reiterated the terms and conditions of the refund policy.
</INST> Is there anything else that you would like to add?
</s> <s><INST> I visited the school campus on 02/03/2022 to discuss the matter. However, the officials categorically denied my request for fees refund. When I asked if at least a partial refund was possible given that the intimation regarding withdrawal from the admission process was done a good two months before the start of the academic year, I did not get a favorable response. 
</INST> Okay, I understand your concern. Under the 2019 Act, education may be considered as a service and therefore brought under the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act. However, the following scenarios may not be covered: 
∙         Conducting Exams.
∙         Issue of Roll No.
∙         Deciding Examination Center.
∙         Evaluating papers.
∙         Canceling Candidature.
∙         Allotting Subjects.
∙         Declaring Results.

</s> <s><INST> Thanks, but I would like to know if I can get a refund in my case. 
</INST> If you have paid the fees for certain facilities, and if they were not provided, then you may be able to get a refund to that extent even if it is non-refundable.
