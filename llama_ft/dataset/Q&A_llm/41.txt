<s><INST> I am unable to use my recently-purchased vehicle due to non-registration of the same by the seller with the RTO. What is my remedy? 
</INST> Hi, I am your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
</s> <s><INST> I visited the Jeevan Nagar branch of Waves, which is one of the authorized dealers of Surrealz, a leading automobile manufacturing company, located in the city of Cosmos on 04/02/2022 at 6:30 pm to purchase a two-wheeler. 
</INST> Could you please briefly describe the vehicle that you purchased? 
</s> <s><INST> Type: Scooter 
           Color: Black
           Brand: Exotic 
           Model Number: A3478621 
</INST> Could you please provide the payment details? 
</s> <s><INST> I bought the scooter for Rs 75,000/- and made the payment for the same by way of NEFT (Transaction ID: 345671948) on 05/02/2022.
</INST> Could you please clearly explain your grievance? 
</s> <s><INST> At the time of purchase of the vehicle, I was told that the formalities with respect to vehicle registration and insurance would be completed in a few days, and that the papers for the same would be handed over as soon as possible. However, that did not happen. It’s been six months since I purchased the vehicle but the process has still not been completed. As a result, I have not been able to use my vehicle. 
</INST> Okay. I understand. Did you approach the seller for an explanation? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did. I called them exactly one month after the date of purchase to enquire about the status, but their reply was evasive and not satisfactory. They never cited a proper reason for not completing the formalities within the promised time period. 
</INST> Did you check with the transport department and the insurance company as to whether they received an application from the seller? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I contacted them on 08/03/2022. They said they have not received any application from the seller.  
</INST> Was there a mechanism to formally register your grievance? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I raised a formal grievance on 06/03/2022 using the website’s customer grievance redressal option.
</s> <s><INST> I also sent an email on 06/03/2022 regarding the same. I went in person on 10/03/2022 to find out about the status of my request, but to no avail. 
</INST> Did you get a reply? 
</s> <s><INST> No, yet to get a reply 
</INST> Is there anything else that you would like to add? 
</s> <s><INST> In fact, I forwarded the reply that I received from the RTO and insurance company to the seller, but it was of no help. 
</INST> Did you consider sending them a legal notice for the deficiency in service? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I sent a notice dated 25/03/2022, but to no avail. I am yet to receive a reply from them with an explanation for the inordinate delay in completing the formalities. 
</INST> I understand. Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I would like to
