<s><INST> My insurance company has failed to relieve the full fund value after I have surrendered the policy. 
</INST> That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, thank you. I had purchased their policy no. 400074122E from agent Pratiksha Madkaikar. I paid the annual premium of Rs. 1 lakh regularly from 2017 to 2021.
</INST> Do you have the policy documents?
</s> <s><INST> Yes I have the original policy document. As per clause D1a, after 5 years I am eligible for the full fund value on surrender.
</INST> Okay. What was the fund value you were expecting?
</s> <s><INST> The total fund value is Rs. 6,69,000 as per my calculations. I submitted the surrender request on 10.05.2022 and followed up with reminder emails/letters on 11.05.2022 and 21.05.2022 along with all documents.
</INST> Alright. And what was their response?
</s> <s><INST> Shockingly, on 29.05.2022 they rejected my claim saying I can only get 1/3rd of the amount and the balance has to be reinvested in a new policy.
</INST> But this is illegal according to the terms you showed me. Do you have their rejection communication?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I have their letter dated 29.05.2022 where they have given vague reasons to deny full payment.
