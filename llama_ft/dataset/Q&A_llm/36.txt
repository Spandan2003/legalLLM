<s><INST> The yield of the crop was much lower than the promised quantity for the seed variety purchased. What do I do now? 
</INST> Hi, I’m your consumer grievance assistance tool. How can I help you?
</s> <s><INST> I purchased the new AX213 variety of chilli seeds from ABC Agro Private Limited on 12/04/2022, and used them in my four-acre plot of land. I was told that the yield would be around 15 quintals, but I got only 8 quintals (Harvest time period: 12/08/2022 – 30/08/2022)
</INST> How many packets of seeds did you purchase, what was the weight of each of the packets and the price of the packet? 
</s> <s><INST> I bought 10 packets of chilli seeds each weighing 250 grams, and the cost price of each of the packets was Rs 3500/-
</INST> Okay. Did you follow the instructions pertaining to the use of the seeds? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I did. 
</INST> Did the terms and conditions have any disclaimer as to the final yield? 
</s> <s><INST> No, there was no mention of anything regarding that. It was an oral promise given by the seller with respect to the yield. 
</INST> Okay. I understand. Please make sure you have something in writing which describes the promise given to you regarding the final harvest. 
</s> <s><INST> Okay. 
</INST> Did you approach the opposite party for compensation? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I first approached them on 10/06/2022 with respect to compensation for the loss incurred in respect of the final output
</s> <s><INST> I also sent reminder emails on 12/06/2022 and 14/06/2022,but to no avail.
</INST> How much did you ask? 
</s> <s><INST> Rs 1,60, 000. Rs 40,000 per acre
</INST> What was their response?
</s> <s><INST> They denied responsibility for the loss 
</INST> Okay. Did you request them to send a sample of the seeds for inspection as per the legal requirements? 
</s> <s><INST> No, I was not aware of the legal provisions in this regard
</INST> That’s okay. I understand
</INST> It is possible that factors such as weather conditions, water usage, fertilizer/pesticide usage, and soil conditions might have played a role in the harvest not being as expected. Did you get a horticultural officer to check your produce? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I called the horticultural officer and the report submitted by him stated that there was an inherent defect in the seeds purchased which resulted in the lower yield per crop. 

</INST> Have you considered sending them a notice? 
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I sent them a notice dated 16/06/2022, but I have not received any reply from them
</INST> Then, would you like to file a complaint before the District Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum?
