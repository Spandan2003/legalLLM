<s><INST> I was cheated by a real estate agency.
</INST> That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
</s> <s><INST> I booked flat 003 in Building 1 of their project for Rs. 26,30,495 on 17/08/2020. I paid an advance of Rs. 5,31,360 in installments. The rest was to be paid after project completion.
</INST> What were the terms regarding sample flat construction?
</s> <s><INST> The agreement said they had to construct a sample flat by November 2020 for my approval. If they failed, the booking would be canceled and I would get a full refund.
</INST> Did the developer meet this requirement?
</s> <s><INST> No, they failed to construct the sample flat by November 2020. It is still not ready as of today.
</INST> What action did you take as a result?
</s> <s><INST> I canceled the booking on 22/04/2021 as per the terms. However, despite the cancellation, the developer has failed to refund my Rs. 5,31,360 advance payment.
</INST> So to summarize, the developer violated the terms by not constructing the sample flat, and also failed to refund your payment upon cancellation?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, that is absolutely correct. They are in blatant violation of the agreement.
