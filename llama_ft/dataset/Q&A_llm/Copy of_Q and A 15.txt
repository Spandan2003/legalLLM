<s><INST> I have been delivered with a defective electric bike.
</INST> That should not be the case. I would try to be of as much help as possible. Can you please tell me more about the incident?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I purchased an electric bike from M/s I Pacific and paid Rs. 1,15,000 as full payment on 30.06.2022 vide invoice number ABC123.
</INST> Do you have the purchase invoice?
</s> <s><INST> Yes I have the original purchase invoice with me. However, within 4-5 months of purchase, the bike started having issues like frequent battery discharge, problems in starting, and lack of pick-up speed.
</INST> Did you try contacting the dealer for servicing when these problems started?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, I approached M/s I Pacific multiple times since December 2022 for inspection and servicing but found their establishment closed down. There was no response on calling them either.
</INST> Okay, so they essentially shut down operations without any notice or intimation to customers?
</s> <s><INST> Yes, that's right. It seems like the company has shut down but I was not informed at all as a customer. The bike is still under warranty period but I have no one to reach out to for servicing now.
</INST> Okay, thank you for the information. You can file a complaint before the consumer court having jurisdiction to hear the case. For that, you must first send a fifteen-day notice to M/s I Pacific. The same can be sent electronically or by post.
